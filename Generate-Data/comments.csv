"Rangnick done his job, I don't know what more you can expect from him, the goals were all there, they don't want to score."
Matic Elanga and Telles make us look like a different team so far.
"if this game ends in a draw it might as well be a loss. arsenal has 3 games in hand and we face city, Tottenham and liverpool in march. we need all 3 points here"
"‚ÄúWe should be up 3/4-0 by now‚Äù

Far too often this season we‚Äôve read those comments in match threads, only for us to end up conceding first and being down at halftime. We‚Äôve lacked that killer instinct to finish our chances and bury lesser teams for far too long."
Back line is a breath of fresh air. Lindelof/Varane partnership is solid.
"I feel more confident with Varane and Lindelof both having the pace to cover for each other. Maguire has his strengths, but if anyone gets the first step on him, it's tough for him to recover"
How do we make Matic 26 years old again
You gotta feel for Ralf with these clowns
"Another example of if we cross remotely in range of Ronnie, it will lead to a dangerous situation."
It‚Äôs remarkable how whenever De Gea has the ball at his feet you just know he‚Äôs about to kick it straight to an opposition player
Elanga playing better and better each game.
Rashford already tired
"players like elanga who've been on the pitch all match still mating sprints trying to win the game. meanwhile Rashford gets subbed on and is jogging around, one touch passing the ball away to watford.  I've wanted to defend him and think he needed time to get back into the game, but it looks like he has no passion or hunger for the game anymore"
"In before the xG stat:

‚ÄúFT: MUN 0 (123.4) - 1 Watford (0.01)‚Äù"
"If that didn't hit Ronaldo, that was going in wow"
Man I wish matic was 28 or something. He‚Äôs so fucking good when he‚Äôs fit.
Lindelof wow
I know Ronaldo has been poor. But playing a 37 year old every match is not logical at all. Yes he's Ronaldo but he's getting old as well. The lack of depth is really fucking us over
What does top 4 matter if we winning the Champions League anyway.
"Good game by the team. Great runs, great chances and great link-up play. I noticed a lot of fluidity with this formation, everyone interchanging positions. Atrocious finishing, particularly on Bruno's early 1v1 and Elanga's wide shot set up beautifully by Pogba.


Hope it's not just Watford being dogshit and that we can carry on playing like this."
Worst crossing team in Europe
"Small critique, didn't like Matiƒá coming off for Rashford even if I understand it. Felt like we relinquished control a bit for little benefit, Marcus looked a yard off the pace."
"We need a backup for Ronaldo, he looked like he hasn‚Äôt been sleeping for 2 days. What an unfortunate timing for Cavani to be injured"
I'm really happy with the impact rangnick has had on the team. We are definitely seeing a style of play form up. Our press is miles better.
No midfield just vibes
Got to love Matic
"Ronaldo has had an absolute stinker today, but god you cannot play a 37 year for 90 mins twice a week all season and expect them to set the world alright. 

I don‚Äôt blame Ralf either. His only other option is play Rashford at centre forward. That hasn‚Äôt worked well with Rash at his best. On current form it‚Äôs simply not an option. Cavani is doing Cavani things. And then we have the Greenwood situation. What a fucking fiasco."
Ronaldos had a really bad game but why didn't anyone else convert their chances. It seemed like everyone on our team wanted their chance to miss a shot
Elanga very much gives me Son vibes. Not a huge amount of flair but devastatingly effective
"Mctominay never takes risks like Matic whether dribbling or passing to break the lines.

In B4 someone tries to convince me McTominay is good going forward because he scored against a shit Leeds team"
gEt rOnAlDo oFf... bro who are u going to bring on? Rashford? youll slag him too
"Also, gotta agree with everyone in here. Vic has been heaps and bounds better in one half with Rapha than Maguire has been the entire season alongside him."
"There is an improvement here, more urgency, more willingness to chase the ball, but only so much ralf can do, not his fault we can't bury the ball in the back of the net"
Team doesn‚Äôt deserve top 4
Can't watch this game for a family commitment. We dominating but no goal to show?
"Ralf sets us up to create chance after chance and we fail to capitalise every week, it's fucking infuriating"
Elanga was the only attacking player performing today and even he missed an absolute sitter
CR7 has played so many games without a break. He is tired. Need a backup striker
Elanga so good
Ronaldo needs to be dropped.
Those boots Varane has on are awesome.
Next training session should simply be hitting the net from the spot.
Matic has been proper.
"Rashford  
Sancho  
Bruno  
Ronaldo  
Elanga

All on the pitch. If we can't score against Watford, sell the whole fucking team."
Im so genuinely confused. How can our finishing be so bad?
Palace just put 4 past them. Norwich scored 3. Leicester 4. And we have 0 at Old Trafford after they beat us 4-1 in their stadium. Need so much more from this team and these players.
Ronaldo has been Watfords best player
This team sucks.   Watford have taken 4 out of a possible 6.   Fucking Watford who are going to get relegated
"It's not a bad performance, it's shit finishing"
Fucking embarrassing
"What Conte said this week really struck a cord with me as a United fan. Managers get shipped out but the players mostly stay the same. I understand there is no way to clear out and replace a half dozen players every window and start fresh, but something else needs to change, and this is not the managers fault. Maybe it never was."
AWB playing he‚Äôs been rebuilt with a first touch and attacking intent
Lindelof ‚ù§Ô∏è
Fred with 47/52 passes and Matic with 42/46 in 1 half! Ridiculous stat
If we drop points today this is on the players. Ralf set up the team nicely.
Lost control after that awful Rashford for Matic sub
This one's on the front line. Ralf's plan worked. They had every opportunity to bury this game in the first 30 and fucking didnt.
Pogba Elanga hold your heads up. Rest of our offensive players can fuck themselves. Sancho you‚Äôre cool too
"If you let Watford get 4 points in the season, you fkng don't deserve top-4"
"> Manchester United have created 19 ‚Äòbig‚Äô chances in their last six games ‚Äî 2nd most in the league behind Liverpool (29). 

>They have converted just five of them. Liverpool have scored 17.

yikes..."
"Love him or hate him, the team clicks better with Pogba."
Cris has been so unlucky. Unbelievable
Matic just oozes class. God I wish he was 26.
it does seem dropping AWB has got a decent response out of him so far
Matic has been wonderful
"Very fluid formation, everyone's been switching positions a lot."
Our high line and quick passes have made a big difference to our play today.
Matic having a good game today
Lindel√∂f x Varane supremacy ‚ò¢Ô∏è
Prime Matic and Prime Mata would complete this team. :(
"Man, Anthony looks BRIGHT."
"Not a new take by any means, but goddamn is it apparent how having a solid DM presence like Matic lifts Fred's game."
"This season could have been very different if we had prioritised a DM in the summer. Yes, before Sancho, before Varane. It was the most glaring position to fill after the Europa League final and still can‚Äôt believe we neglected it."
All out attack lmao
Good for Rangnick for saying fuck it
Wtf rash
how does Cristiano score 40 off a midfield of Bentancur Arthur Bernardeschi and struggling to score 20 here lol
This kind of match is so frustrating. We got everything right except for the end product.not winning such matches is extra infuriating
What a joke. Watford didn‚Äôt even try to compete. They just gave us the ball and we couldn‚Äôt do anything. Our defense for once wasn‚Äôt exposed but our forwards were ass. Wingers couldn‚Äôt get in decent crosses. Can‚Äôt blame the manager. Players need a sports psychologist
Matic please be 5 years younger
"matic is such a baller, wished he was younger"
Why is Awb getting so much criticism? He‚Äôs been decent so far. Been good playing out the back and whipped a decent ball.
Matic is a beast today
Matic is playing really well
Living for this Matic.
A younger matic would be awesome
So which Watford player do we think will score early in the second half? That's the usual script for this kind of performance.
The fans in this sub man üòÇ
Ralf has been coaching excelently. This players are letting him and us down time and time again.
Rangnick the mad man wtf
Rash is so bad despite being fresh
"This goes back to that Bruno 1v1 miss, if we score there the game is so much more open"
You know What‚Äôs crazy is that was was our easiest fixture Till April.
I'm glad I didn't watch the game otherwise I would be fuming lol
"Strap in for the month to come, we're about to come up against.... actual good teams. This could get painful, especially if the return leg with Atletico pisses all over the fans."
"I think I changed my mind about Elanga. The guy is clearly premier league quality at the very least with a lot of room to grow. A lot has to go right for him to be world class, but he can at least carve out a nice career in the top leagues."
"Always so weird. So many takes that are just the opposite of each other haha. Some say Pogba was excellent, others say shit etc. For me Bruno has been the most disappointing. 3 easy opportunities that he squandered today. Yeah Ronaldo looked burnt, but he was making some top tier passes that set up opportunities today."
Ralf coaching another 4-0. Too bad the players don't agree.
"The thought of that prick Arteta getting Arsenal into top 4 over us is fucking depressing. God, I fucking hate the torture these pricks put me through. IT WAS FUCKING WATFORD YOU BUNCH OF USELESS TWATS!!"
This is the Reddit lineup so let‚Äôs hope it works
xG having a day
Watford will get one proper chance and they will score.
"This is Watford who thrashed us last time around.  

Come on guys!!! Score some goals!"
Victor should be starting ahead of Maguire
What a ball by pogba
That was ace by Lindelof
What does Ralf have to do? These players are infuriating
I like the energy from elanga when he gets the ball and go inside
So if the team looks better with their captain on the bench what is the next course of action? Is it ok to have your captain on the bench day in day out?
"Man Ralf has really proved me wrong as of recent. His tactics have been class, the *players* just cant finish."
Anybody in love with Matic performance?
Varane and Lindelof looking solid in defense and build up
So who‚Äôs the striker we‚Äôre going to obsess over in the summer?
Rashford is just dumb
What the fuck happened with Rashford there?
Sancho is very silky it‚Äôs insane
"Nobody today has been even close to Sancho and Elanga‚Äôs level. Elanga may have missed a chance but he has been electric

Get us a striker and CDM please Murtough"
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll bounce back‚Äù posts incoming
How? Most frustrating game under Ralf.
"That's not even funny anymore, our whole frontline is lacking except a 19 year old kid that now its his first senior season."
How did these guys beat us 4-1.
"The team is finally playing Rangnick's game, quick passing, good pressing"
Wish we can find a Matic regen. He makes us so much better than McTominay
Let Telles take the fk
Just want to point out that Elanga is playing with great maturity.
Not a bad freekick tbh
This is the first time I don‚Äôt want a sub in the second half
This match should have been put to bed by now ffs.
Really impressed with elanga's confidence on the ball
We should be up multiple goals at this point.
"Three games in hand by Arsenal, we have to win games like this."
I seriously cannot understand how this game is 0-0
"Pogba has gone from CAM, LW, CM, and now CDM lol."
"Ronaldo Rashford Bruno Sancho Elanga Pogba 

Now that's a proper Fergie-style closeout front line against weaker teams"
"Elanga, Ronaldo, Bruno (x3), AWB, Pogba have all missed easy chances now."
"Roy means business, he's taken his specs off"
Foster should let one in for old times' sake c'mon
Bruno shooting because fans shouted shoot. Demn.
Ronaldo has been wank
Ronaldo is actually done man
Ralf has managed the game great. The players can't finish
"Shit this is it's not RR's fault.  He's got us playing attacking football, creating chances, we just can't finish"
What more does Ralf need to do!!! These fucking players should give their weeks wages to charity. Fucking appaling this
Would have much rather seen Jeese on instead of Rashford
"When Rashford has the ball, I know the play is dead. So frustrating"
"P A I N

A

I

N"
We have a lot of fake world class players
Bruno takes the most blame for this. Elanga also should have buried that. Ronaldo also on that pass by Bruno.
"Matic MOTM. I don't think he had the legs for the full 90 so I get bringing him off, but we lost a ton of drive when he came off."
"just rest ronaldo if it's not against top team, he won't even make a run, way too old. If it's top team, he has the energy"
"The performance was good. Gotta take our chances. Young, hungry striker needed this window"
Shaw came in just to over shoot everything. How did we not get 1 in? Just 1.
"We‚Äôre actually playing really good, just need a goal"
Lads you need to understand. We don‚Äôt need top 4. We winning the ucl.
  Ahh Ronaldo off the post‚Ä¶. so close
Damn AWB Great cross
It's good to see someone accompanying Ronaldo in the box
"Yep it's going to be one of those games for sure.

Edit. Welp like I said. You could just tell. After those chances didn't go in, it was over."
What a ball in by Ronaldo
Elanga and Ronaldo link up is something!
WE LOOK A LOT MORE UP FOR IT COMPARED TO USUAL WEEKS
Fuck. Another ridiculous buildup that starts with Elanga
Jeez we could have been 4 up
Hope Ralf takes notes as this is possibly one of the best teams we can line up with. How many extremely close chances we have had
We create so many chances under Ralf. Refreshing
This is easily the best game from United in a while. Gotta say Watford are not playing their best game but still great for United's confidence to simply dominate a game.
HOW ARE WE NOT WINNING!!
We are wasting chances left and right but atleast I‚Äôm enjoying how we‚Äôre playing
"I know it‚Äôs Watford but this is easily the best build up play we‚Äôve done for a while, unlucky in the box and Bruno seems a bit off but how we‚Äôve not found the back of the net is beyond me"
Telles is a handsome man
"CR7 actually allowed someone to take the free kick!    
It's good he's letting someone else try after his abysmal attempts."
Matic out here breaking ankles lol
"Not bad, at least Ronaldo was told to go away lol.

Telles has a lovely kick of the ball, wether on FKs, corners or crosses."
Can we get some De-Aging serum for Matic?
Best lineup in a while. I‚Äôm here for Matic all day. Would love to see his impact against Atletico
I C E M A N
That block by the Iceman was sexy
Nice having two mobile CBs
It's like a breath of fresh air without Maguire at the back
I hope it pours once we get going.
"We can only dominate one half, and we missed all the sitters in that half we dominated. Fuck."
Elanga needs to start every game from now on. Rashford needs to earn his place back by making the most of sub appearances.
Get Sancho on
We could‚Äôt finish in a whorehouse.
this cycling gk lad aint too shabby
Lindelof has had a helluva game.  Not a single wrong move.
It's been clear all season the refs don't want to give Ronaldo a penalty. Some of the VAR decisions against us this year have been baffling
"Whoever performed this blood magic against us, it isnt funny anymore. You made your point."
"Feel like this game dispells the idea we aren't physically fit enough, we've been good for 70 mins now, it's just a mentality thing the moment we go ahead we switch off"
Our back 4 along with Matic has been huge today.
This is just a real life version of how FIFA treats me when I‚Äôm United playing Harrowgate Town in the FA cup
"I for one, love Ralf and his subs. Shows that he wants to WIN."
"Ralf: *These fellas, pain in my assholes*"
"Elanga is running his arse off, good on em"
Ronaldo looks like he's lost all confidence in himself ffss
What a frustrating way to spend an afternoon
Ronaldo has 1 goal in 2022 and it's nearly March for fuck sake
"Domnated for 90 minutes by Atleti, scrape a draw. Dominate Watford for 90 minutes, only get a draw. We are a very average team right now."
"*criticises player X*

**Why is everyone criticising player X , look at the state of player A, B, C & D, they've been far worse**

Basically what we've been reduced to"
watching this game is how i felt when i did not study for an exam and missed an A by a few points.
"I love him but we're going nowhere with Ronaldo up top, sign Isak and a competent CDM in the summer."
"cool, cool, cool. So top 4's done then. We can't beat Watford or Burnley we're not beating City or 'pool."
22 attempts for 3 on target ...  Plus a bunch that don't even count as shots
"We‚Äôre a midtable team with a chance at Fourth, and European football left to play.  That‚Äôs just the way it is ‚Äî it DID feel like we were trying to win in the end though."
Van de Beek looking good
"Not hating on Maguire, but our build up seems better without him holding the ball for so long everytime"
"If we 0-0 this or lose, I will be very upset and continue to watch this dumpster fire for the rest of the season"
"Greenwood career is over
Edinson spends his days in Hospital 
Rashford is mentally gone from the game

Next we have 37 year old Ronaldo
18 year old Elanga..

Top 4 gone..was probably the easiest match till April!!"
"Waiting for that biweekly ""We go again post."" from De Gea."
So unlucky!!!!
Elanga lol get after it kid!!!
If Bruno would've scored that good god
Nasa studying that shot
How is this not 3-0
"Elanga has been electric, im gonna overhype him !!!"
Starting to think Watford aren't very good tbh
ELANGA IS AMAZING WTFFF
Telles over shaw any fucking day
We're looking good I gotta say.
Elanga is really intelligent. He might not have the toolset that Rashy has in terms of his dribbling ability. But give me intelligence over all that.
Gonna go out on a limb here and say that this is the best I‚Äôve seen us play in at least a year. Look at the aggression and willingness to play !
[deleted]
Elanga is so good
When you created so many chances that it feels you're ahead and you take the foot of the gas only for the team to punish you
How are the comments so negative? We‚Äôre playing some of the best football we have all season. Our goals are coming. We look great.
Love how bulky Matic looks on the ball. It isn‚Äôt always pretty but he does the simple things well
xG gonna be 10 at the end of the half
Wan Bissaka playing well
this should be our starting backline for the foreseeable future
I actually love that Ralf is using the squad and not playing the same 11 players
Varane is a brick wall.
Ref needs to sort his shit out; a dribbling Anthony falling in the box = penalty
I have no idea how to judge this.. looks like elanga fell on him
Lindelof has been solid so far today
Lindelofffffff
great pass by Pogba
Our forwards are just fucking gash as per usual. Should be 3 or 4 nil.
Here before we concede a sticky one 10 seconds into second half
"Finishing not there but this has been the best half we have played in well over a year. The goals will come for sure but this has been very enjoyable to watch. Bruno has been everywhere, Pogba really good, Elanga very energetic and hell, even Fred has looked outstanding. Loving this !"
"Good half, entertaining. Can't help but be worried that we might be ass in the next 45 but we go again! Hope we can bag some goals. Elanga was electric early."
Perfect game for sancho to come and dominate the left
"Matic looking hungry today, love to see it"
Matic is mocking it with these passes. Wish we had him in his prime
Pogba holy shit what a touch
Elanga is going to be special. You can just feel it.
"Oh, come on. Exquisite play but that should be a goal."
Sancho winner incoming
It‚Äôs been a prime Matic display today. Rolling back the years
Matic has been so good.
This Lindelof Varane partnership is sooo good.
Fucking ronnie ran away from sancho when sancho needed an extra man and help.
"Two steps forward, then face plant."
Look at the positions matic takes compared to McT. So much better
This is a good time for Rash to remember how to score.
Come on United!! You can do it
Ronaldo shat the bed with reckless abandon there.
Ronaldo has lost all dynamism
Can‚Äôt see how people still stick up for Ronnie. I love the guy but he has lost that killer instinct recently
Age really is catching up to Ronaldo
Rashford non existent
"Jesus, Ronaldo wasted like dozens of chances here."
We don't deserve Top 4
Looks like the Champions League is out of the menu lads. Shite result.
We can‚Äôt even score against Watford. Fucking Watford.
Rashford has harmed us more since he came on than helped us
"Ronaldo doesn't even jump anymore.

Remember when he used to just hang in the air"
Pogba is beyond gassed at this point.
Goodnight brothers and sisters it‚Äôs 1am here
0-1-1 against fucking Watford this season
"Unbelievable we didn‚Äôt win that, unreal."
"If i see one ""we go again"" post I swear to God.."
Bruno realizes he doesn‚Äôt have to do it all anymore right? Dude gave away so many chances in the second half with his crosses that never got above 2 feet off the ground and his shots into the upper deck
Reminder that our top pl goalscorer from open play of the last decade has gone to Seville
FFS just one of those games unfortunately
"This is squad depth catching upto us. No 37 year old should play 3 games in 7 days. At this point, I'd wager getting someone from the academy as a spare striker."
Absolute shambles. You can bring a Pep-Klopp lovechild to manage this shitshow and they‚Äôll still lose because there is so much deadweight
elengas transition to the first team hasnt been a huge issue so get so more youth players in‚Ä¶ a young striker surley cant be worse than ronaldo we cant rely on a 37 year old to play all the matches left
The match thread asking to take off Fred and AWB at half time is proof some of you don‚Äôt even watch the match lol
Let's send them down to the Championship
"SO CLOSE, RONNIE!"
"Good lord, what did AWB eat for breakfast? Beasting it so far"
This is the 4-2-2-2 again isn't it? Pogba doesn't look like he's playing on the left
Come on DdG wtf
"There it is, one poor distribution from De Gea again.  Just need one amazing save and that completes the routine."
Ronnie‚Äôs like if I can‚Äôt score won‚Äôt let anyone else score üòÇ
How have we not scored yet.
Wtf Bruno wtf
Bruno should score that
That was such a sexy buildup. Elanga is fast as fuck
"Please God, don't be one of those games where we can't score for an entire half, despite cunting the opposition only to draw 1-1"
"looking like a great team and wasting chances again, seems like second half disasterclass is coming once again"
Should be fucking 3-0 up.
"There are 4 ex-ManUtd players in Watford's starting 11, Ben Foster, Craig Cathcart, Tom Cleverley, Joshua King."
"Jesus Christ we've replaced the Cunt and some with Elanga the boy is class, so smooth on the ball"
Elanga's cementing his starting spot
I really believe Lindelof is miles ahead of Maguire
The difference between having the black hole of possession in Rashford and an in form Elanga is night and day.
"2 good midfielders. Elanga playing. Maguire out


This is a dream"
United Fred starting to resemble Brazil Fred under Ralf
We have needed this Matic all season long
I think we all know where this is going
"xG - 965.

Actual goals - 0"
It‚Äôs not spoken of much but AWB has improved his game going forward‚Ä¶
Elanga is a really smart player
Would love another elanga goal. He is a man in form
FFS CAN WE FINISH A CHANCE PLEAS
Seems like Elanga and Ronaldo have a good understanding of each others movements. We need to build more chemistry with our forwards
xG going crazy
Matic moving like a 20 year old out there
"I say this every time Matic plays, his biggest quality is that he always moves the ball forward. If only his legs were still there"
"United will score 2 before half time, I just know it. This manifestation thing better work"
Must be so frustrating being a manager. You do everything well with your team to set them up right and counter the opponent and then the players miss sitters
Pls not Wallnaldo freekick
"The biggest advantage matic offers over McT is he moves the ball extremely quickly, penetratively and over a long distance when we regain possession. McT often plays too short passes and by the time we move forward, opposition are back in shape which makes it difficult to break them down."
"One of these goddamn chances is going to go in, and then we'll start cookin'em. This could be a fun 4-0 or better by the end of it!"
"Commentator ""Bruno focused, telles, still there""

2 seconds later, telles takes fk üòÇ"
If we don‚Äôt score we‚Äôre going to set a record for the highest xG ever in a loss.
"Good lord, Matic has been so satisfying to watch."
Pogba is a strong lad
I feel both fullbacks have been good. Elanga and Ronaldo as well. Only downside has been finishing.
Not to be too much of a negative Nancy but watford are very very bad
They won‚Äôt give that.
Why can't we both play well and score goals?
What a ball by Pogba
Poor by Matic but great way to win the ball from Lindelof.
Thats Vidicsque tackle by Iceman !
Lol what? Did the ref just change who‚Äôs throw it was because the player shouted ‚Äúour ball‚Äù ???
our defence and play looks so much better without maguire
"I'm scared about the second half... We already know that we're incapable of having two good halfs, and this half has been pretty good, only missing some goals.  

Crossing everything I have that Watford doesn't get some jammy goal and park the bus second half."
"You can guarantee that if that was a Watford attacker and a United defender, the ABU's in r/soccer would have declared it a stonewall penalty.  And it would probably have been given on the field."
How we‚Äôre not 3 goals up is crazy
" Ralf: This is a 6 - 0
Players: No"
Bet it ends 1-1 because we can't score a fucking goal. Rangnick's coached us to 3 or 4 nil but the players we put at the front almost refuse to fucking capitalize.
"The goals will come, totally dominating a poor Watford side. Same again 2nd half and we won‚Äôt have a problem, please turn up for the 2nd half!"
High line is the way to go going forward. Reduces distances between the lines and makes for easier pressing. No surprises we've created plenty of chances as a result.
"It just feels like Ronaldo is either offside, takes a bad touch or just doesn't have the pace."
Elanga is looking great.
imagine if our other defensive midfielders could pass like matic ...
This team is allergic to finishing their dinner
Wtf Pogba that was beautiful
Beautiful play. Can‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs not a goal. Everything was perfect.
If that went in I would have sucked RR off. No kidding. #nohomo
So unlucky today
It could've been 10-0
Big game from Fred!
"There's isn't anyone to blame , Manager, Midfield, Defense... everyone has done their job brilliantly. It's just that kind of day"
Ronaldo is on the edge of implosion
"The ball played in to AWB is near perfect and still he runs awkwardly forward forgetting the ball, I just can't sometimes"
It's a shame Cavanis mystery injury means he cant play today .
"On some unrelated good news, Erickssen is playing now"
How do the coach handle when he sees this? Mentally taxing with these lot on the amount of shots they don't convert.
Unrequited xG FC
Only two of our shots were on target? How? That makes zero sense
Shaw and Rashford coming on. Draw or loss confirmed.
If we don‚Äôt score it‚Äôs goodbye to top 4‚Ä¶ this should be the new chant
We will score. BELIEVE.
Bold move by Ralf taking Fred and Matic off
"Ralf has to go for it, we are fucked if we drop points here. Brutal fixtures coming up."
"The legendary no midfield formation lmao

pls win boys"
This might be one of the most absurd matches I‚Äôve ever seen!
fucking infuriating
"Another middlesborough incoming. One thing is for sure, this isn‚Äôt on the manager it‚Äôs completely on the players. Sad thing is despite creating so many chances the players might start to lose confidence if we don‚Äôt win"
Should‚Äôve kept Telles on.
Good for Cleverly getting some applause
we should stop crossing. our balls on the ground is much better than shooting for the moon
Watch denis get a 94th minute winner.
"0 - 0 incoming. Typical for a match we dominate. Either we score and play shit, or play good and dont score. Wtf."
Fuck off Rashford
Why didn‚Äôt rashford lace it?!?! Leaving it for who??
Rashford and Sancho combo on left hand side is not working well. They are making the same run.
Arsenal licking their lips now. We need to score god damnit!
Rashford uninterested in scoring it seems. Who is he leaving that for
Elanga and Sancho causing havoc on the wings but there is fuck all end product to pass to
"I'll say again, why was Ronaldo not taken off!"
Ronnie having a tough one
"Ronaldo genuinely has lost his legs, can't even dribble these days"
Give us at least PL level striker and we‚Äôll be comfortably ahead of Arsenal and Spurs
Man Ronaldo really has become a shell of the player he once was. Doesn‚Äôt look like a threat at all.
Ronaldo can barely dribble with the ball now. What's going on with him???
I cant take a 0-0 at home against bloody Watford
Ronaldo can't do counter attacks anymore....really struggles to turn
"Rashford, Pogba walking around as our players are looking for an option. No hunger"
"Top 4 was still there for the taking when Ole was sacked. 

We have dropped so many points to beatable teams since then and now we are heading into an actually difficult run of games.

Gonna be really really tough to get top 4 if we don‚Äôt get something here."
"Not sure how any honest fan can think this ‚Äúteam‚Äù deserves top-4.

How many times do we have to drop vital points to relegation fodder before people realize we just aren‚Äôt good enough? Don‚Äôt be surprised if we end up 7th at the end of the season‚Ä¶this was supposed to be our EASY run of PL fixtures. March is going to be a disaster month."
"Currently, 1 point and a -3 GD vs Watford this season"
"We've gone from being unable to create chances, but getting goals from nowhere, to creating all the chances but not being able to finish them."
Elanga is so much better than Rashford it's crazy.
Ronaldo is fooling absolutely no one with his chops!
The fuck was that pass from Ronaldo?
So many players finished in this team. Bring on the summer rebuild.
hello darkness my old friend
No CL next season then lads
I prefer Dalot over AWB
Bruno needs to take his mental game up a level if we ever hope to win trophies with him. He‚Äôs too desperate and rash.
How on earth did we not win that
The boos are loud and clear
What a shitshow. So many chances and we missed all of them
If ronaldo wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe goat‚Äù he would mever come off the bench
22 shots and just 3 on goal‚Ä¶ offensive so disappointing today plenty of chances created
Top four gone. Absolutely pathetic final third performance
As if a change in manager is going to change anything. These players!!
We need a proper centre forward and a DM. Ronaldo isn't it anymore. Matic had a great game and should be used as an example of how well we'd attack with a proper DM
"Can start to see the improvements under Ralf, but we need a striker to get any sort of results... 3 on target is really poor given the number of chances created..."
This could've been a 3-0 even if they converted half of the chances. Ralf would be fuming.
Oh yeah and AWB you‚Äôve benched Dalot for the time being great performance
"This is the match to show why the club needs to consider statistical model/data before buying any new players, not based on fame/moment/emotion."
We win games where we don't deserve. We draw or lose games where we deserve to win
"If that was Harry instead of linedlof, it would‚Äôve been a goal"
I think a goal would be nice to have before the end of the game
Can't blame Ralf here this is mental so many wasted chances. Bright side best we've played
"Everyone is talking shit about Ronaldo, okay he is past his prime but we are not gonna talk about Bruno too?
We should have been 3-0..we definitely need a striker"
Cristiano has been so unlucky these past few games man.
Damn Ronaldo
Noooo
"Instead of a new DM, can we just use the money to get Matic bionic legs?"
Can we just transplant Matic‚Äôs brain into McT‚Äôs body
It's verging on impressive how often DDG manages to perfectly find the opposition players with his kicks
Elanga chant sounds so good
"Bruno just ran past my front window, he's still going!"
"Build a bonfire, build a bonfire, put the Scousers at the top, put Putin in the middle and we'll burn the fucking lot."
Could have been 2-0
Bruuunnoooüò≠
Elanga is a fucking baller my god
What a move ! Should have score there Bruno lmao
Only if our front three were not tunnel visioned we would be 2-0 up
Elanga is so good.
Loving this football
I really think Ralfie can do a proper job here if he was given time and money.
Elanga was OBSCENE in that move
"Suii....

FUCK"
Elanga is fucking electric
Elanga teaching rashy not to run into defenders
This team is playing fantastic football today
"Elanga is a superstar, holy shit Sweden is blessed."
Rhythm is a Pastor
Pogba Matic absolutely dominating the midfield.
We are having a great first half...just hope this doesn't mean a crazy 2nd half
Man our attack today so joy to watch even still not get goal yet
Lindelof never gets fucking fouls called
PLEASE PUT THE BALL IN THE GOAL
Tbh that‚Äôs not an easy chance.
Fuck this finishing
We‚Äôre playing some beautiful football but we just can‚Äôt finish to save our lives.
Glorious start. Shambolic finishing. Please United not another 1-1 draw
This team get emotional and panicky way too early in a game. Just keep it ticking with tempo and we win easily
The tweak by Rangnick to play Pogba behind Cristiano has been a good move. Lots of chances being created.
best 20min all season
We‚Äôve seen this before. Miss countless chances and score one in the 1st half then come out abysmal in the second half.
I'm tired of our finishing costing us later in the game. Let's please not repeat history
There's someone on the Watford bench who's screaming his lungs out every time an attacker closes down one of our defenders.
Amazing dribble by wan bissaka
Bruno oh my.
Fernandes could‚Äôve had a hattrick by now instead has none
Damn that was a loud scream.
The goal could be the size of the whole stand and we'd miss it right now
It's so fucking annoying that that's not a penalty because Ronaldo stayed up.
If CR7 went down and it wasn't given it would be so much worse
This is ending 1-1 and we all know it.
Idc about the scoreline I‚Äôm loving this football
"& there it is! 
3 of the best, he‚Äôs made them pay & that completes the hattrick!‚Ä¶. Of misses for Bruno today üò≠"
"I love how Telles is finally showing us why we bought him, some excellent involvements this game."
The team looks lively today. I‚Äôm enjoying this
"Fred is amazing. Please get him a DM this summer, the man deserves it and we as fans deserve it."
Surely a goal has to come soon when we‚Äôre creating chances like this
Matic is still levels above McTominay. He‚Äôs been class
Anybody else miss Mata taking our free kicks?
We need a long distance goal from Matic
"Dont worry boys, I have to wee, we will score now."
Fredic is the new mcfred but better
AWB told Dalot to catch him outside
"Despite not having scored yet, this team is light years ahead of the one that got thumped 4-1."
Fred has played well
Matic is just commanding that midfield.
"Sad to say that might be the best refereeing I‚Äôve seen all season. Just cause you keep the ball, doesn‚Äôt mean you should play advantage"
"‚ÄúChance for United to work Ben Foster‚Äù 

*Ronaldo steps up*

Never mind‚Ä¶"
Set pieces are worse for us than kryptonite was for Superman.
Matic so good lol
I‚Äôd give my right arm for 27 year old Matic. What a baller in that holding midfield role. Exactly what this team needs
"I don't know if that was a pen, but that was some fluid football!"
If Maguire does that it‚Äôs a pen for sure
Well that was never a pen
I feel so much more confident with this CB pairing.
Looked a lot worse in real time for me. Fair play to the ref for not calling that penalty.
Lindel√∂f is a beauty
Pogba‚Äôs Pass Accuracy is one of the best in the world
I know its Watford but doesn‚Äôt it seem like our whole backline seems more uniform and composed this match?
 Lindelof wow
We need to come out firing on all cylinders after the half. Having 66% possession and no goals is a disappointment.
We are really improving tbh even if its Watford we still are balling. I really hope ralf gets a 2 year contract
Elanga is so fast.
"It's a shame Cavani plays once every full moon, we need a finisher so bad."
"What a ball from Matic

Wtf is Pogba waiting for????"
Matic is superb
"Once again, the ball from Matic was exquisite!"
yea instead of passing he is trying to outplay 4 players wtf pogba
"Rashford watching the play like ""How can I offer less than Pogba when I come on"""
That was so sexy and fuck we can‚Äôt score
"That was magic

Unlucky"
This is fucking unreal.
What a play
Elanga you need to bury that OMG!!
Bro when we score there is going to be an eruption. This team is legit giving me blue balls
How was that not a penalty and how haven't we scored? Magical from Pogba
"Pogba is different breed, he's just different"
"We've created enough chances to win 5 or 6 matches, this is ridiculous"
Elanga is hungry. Hungry players make all the difference.
"Someone check the watford goalpost, might have some curse or voodo there"
Most people seem so stressed! I‚Äôm enjoying this match. We‚Äôre playing amazing and the goal is gonna come. To me this feels much much better than to be winning with a lucky goal and being dominating hoping for the match to end.
There's unlucky and then there's whatever is happening today. Simply unbelievable that we haven't score a single goal yet.
Fuck off Kevin Friend
2 goals we have blocked ourselves
Brilliant by Bruno
who the fuck has voodoo'd us
Should be 5-0. Unbelievable lack of quality in the end product
It wasn't going in even if Elanga didn't touch it
This is unbelievable
This is getting silly
Not sure I like Fred being taken off.
"I admire Pogba's unselfishness. But with the skillet he has, he should really be trying to bang it in from 20+ yards more often."
Can we pay 6 mil to get Matic some new legs
I can't take the edging much longer
Ronaldo bloody hell.
United playing the goal is lava.
Mike Phelan standing round like a bouncer outside a club
We are playing well creating chances. Just missing the final finish. It‚Äôs coming. GGMU
Our own players stopped 2 shots on goal.
Lol we're really going 2-0-8
no holding midfielders and Inshallah
Good game from matic. Had some great passes today
"Rangnick: No Mercy, time to sweep the leg."
Shaw to AWB.  At least we have players inside the box
I can't remember any other manager trusting our defense this much and go so attacking. I like it
At least we are winning the Xg battle
That was a filthy one touch pass by Sancho to Shaw
How have we not scored with this much firepower on at one time
How are we not scoring yet
20 fucking attempts
Matic looked quality today
We use a new crossing technique called switching flanks
Rashford and shaw movements is so bad
I gotta say. Rashford and shaw subs havent been good
That's lack of confidence from Rashford
Rashford wtf just wtf?
We belong in the Europa League.
My god rashford is fuxking awful
"Rashy, Buddy, what‚Äôs going on with you"
Elanga is insane.
WTF RONNIE
FFS Ronaldo
What is going on with Cristiano
Ronnie‚Ä¶. Wtf
Ffs Ronaldo wtf
Yeah Ronnie looks too old for the prem
Think Ronaldo should have come off but it's not as if we have a center forward.. sad
Ronaldo is cooked. Hurts us more than helps us.
Ronaldo is godawful
Fuck Putin
"Ronaldo's legs are gone. He can't play every fucking match, and 90 minutes every match"
How are we not punish them for the 4-1. Fuck this shit
This looks to be the one game I will have no answer for the stream of Ronaldo criticism.
Roy is just as shocked as we are.
How is Cavani hurt? Does he just take off weeks when he feels like it? Hardly plays
Prepping for a colonoscopy would be more enjoyable yet I can‚Äôt stop watching
Have our players seen our March fixtures. These are the games we needed to win FFS
Can't believe we've given away 4 points to this God awful team
We finish worse than a secondary school team. Top 4 is gone for sure now.
Midtable united fucking dogshit
Ben foster is such a time wasting bastard
"I‚Äôve no doubt Bruno will find form again soon, but I have my doubts about Ronaldo, and Rashford is certainly finished. The tactics are good, the finishing is poor."
"I always tell myself I am not going to watch Man U games,they just ruined my day"
Top 4 gone
Arsenal are getting fourth. This season is done. We have a lot of players who can make something happen in one moment but one moment out of ninety isn‚Äôt good enough.
"Its such a waste when bruno hits it from so far out. It always goes wide, doesnt have power or it get blocked by a defender. He needs to make smarter choices aswell. He could have passed to ronaldo on an easy sweaty tap in"
"This team simply doesn't deserve UCL football next year... This was one of the worst seasons post Fergie so far, unless we turn things up and win every game left to play or UCL."
"It‚Äôs possible we don‚Äôt get too 4 and lose Greenwood, Pogba, Cavani, Ronaldo and Martial all in the summer."
Ronaldo after getting hit by Bruno‚Äôs shot ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Man, it hurts to see Ronaldo this bad, Maybe City would have been a better choice for him"
"Am i the only one here that is loving what Im seeing ? Sure, the goals are not there but we have been playing outstanding football. The negativity here is amazing"
Ronaldo is finished. No more aging strikers at this club please
Fred is amazing so far I can‚Äôt believe Im saying this
"Matic moving with the ball, taking his man on and looking to keep the ball ticking is such a welcome change from the usual McTominay side pass show"
"We need a younger striker, someone with hunger, and someone who can play every game. No disrespect to Ronaldo, but his and Messi‚Äôs generation is over."
Telles was putting in better crosses than shaw.
I just wan to go into a coma and wake up next season
"We never had serious issues with scoring goals with Ole even when it looked strange and unconvincing.

Now for some reason when we have all the control, better chances and the team looks like an actual team we can't score.
A lot of goals we scored under Ole came from nowhere and now when we have better chances with well worked passes we can't score? I just don't get it."
"Actually not as pissed off with this draw as compared to our previous bad results. There was some really good football played today and the urgency to get forward was really good. Only thing that lacked was the finishing product. A lot of people taking a dig at Ronaldo now and I can understand it. He‚Äôs been poor. But im sure this is just a slump in form and he‚Äôll get better again. Just looking at the table makes me sad at the moment. All in all, some good stuff played today. Unlucky not to win the game. We have to keep fighting and get behind the team. They have improved a lot. Let that at least be a reason to get behind them."
CR7 really is cursed. There‚Äôs no other explanation. The forces of nature are conspiring against him.
"Feeling a 6-1, Pogba assist masterclass. Let's have it!"
United against war
That was so great to see them holding up the peace sign. And then to have the Watford players ask to join!
"Godspeed, gentlemen üôèüèΩüíú"
Bruno smashing that fake shot like it's fifa
Pogba in a very advanced role?
Movement from Ronaldo was good but unfortunately defender was too tall
Ronaldo really should have scored that man
Banging tunes coming from United fucking love Elangas chant
My god what a move. Fuck
Bruno has to bury that. Elanga looks great so far.
Give Ronaldo
Oh come on Bruno
Bruno been dire so far
"How is it possible that everyone is so unclinical lately? Like even Ronnie, a guy known to be historically clinical, is not clinical lately. Why?"
I‚Äôm loving Elanga‚Äôs pace on the pitch.
I‚Äôm convinced someone is dicked 7-0 before the end of the season.
"Not gonna lie, we are playing really good. Wish we were more efficent. RR would also like that"
Fuck me that was so good
cucked by the offside flag ffs
Elanga looking amazing
What a magnificent build-up.
Elanga is electric
Elanga‚Äôs passing is on point today
Good Lord Elanga is class
"Damn it, Ronnie can't catch a break."
Elanga is a proper player
Elanga what a fucking gem
Rhythm is a dancer!
I wish Matic was 10 years younger he‚Äôs so good
How refreshing is it to have creative wingers like Sancho and Elanga that are smooth on the ball and bring other players into the game. So much better than Rashford and Greenwood hogging the ball and trying to score wonder goals with zero awareness of their teammates.
Who knew playing Pogba in a more advanced position would help our attack? /s
We are looking GOOOOOOD today
Loving Elanga.
Got about 15 more mins before matic is tired. Please score before that
Bruno and Ronaldo trying not to score today or what's up?
Lol well. We could have 5
"We are playing great but we have seen this movie before, missed chances and 1 good chance for Watford changes everything."
"Should be 4-0, come on boys."
"Is this our best XI?

Maybe Chuck sancho in the mix?"
"Bruno and Ronaldo should both have a couple already. 

Attack looks juicy, just need someone to finish"
Lindelof and Pogba passes are always a joy to watch.
xG merchants...fucking score..damn
The football is certainly picking up under Ralf
The amount of chances this team fails to convert is so painful. Thankfully Watford haven‚Äôt been too much of a threat because we should easily be up 2-0 right now.
"We better score soon, or I‚Äôm gonna have to intervene"
"Can't at all fault game prep, build up, wing play and final passes here. 


We're completely prepped...but finishing is eyyyyy"
That‚Äôs a joke by Bruno
Bruno wtf
Bruno is having a shocker‚Ä¶
"Oh yeah these are the kind of games you draw or lose haha, you don‚Äôt miss these chances without it coming back to haunt you."
"Good stuff from Elanga & Ronnie, it looked like Bruno should've at least hit the target."
"We have not played this well in years. Like really, the amount and quality of chances we're making üëèüèΩfk the finishing,  but you gotta give Rangnick and everyone's performance"
Alone in the box and he fucking does that lmao
This game is answer for people who say what ronaldo does except scoring goals
"Why is it so that if you fall you get a penalty, but if you try to stay up you will not get rewarded by one??"
Ronnie could have went down there and that was a pen. I'm surprised he didn't. Its a foul.
Yeah Ronny should've gone down.
It takes more effort not to score all these chances.
"Fucking hell, can't we just have one game where we convert these chances and win convincingly, it's either chances galore and one shitty goal or no chances and a shitty goal."
I swear to God if these bastards score after all of our squandering.
TBT to when Scholes would play that Matic pass 10+ times a match
Ronaldo is getting edged hard this game
Foster really wants that YT career then.
Our corners are still shit..
Ronaldo is gonna score today for sure
[deleted]
"Matic has been absolute class today, just super solid and calm"
It‚Äôs just not happening for Cristiano at the moment but I believe he will score today.
Matic <3
A bit tired matic is class
Alexa: how to get rid of the yips?
"Telles should take this FK

Pls no Ronaldo"
Louza is a bit of an unfortunate name
Please let Telles take this
Awb masterclass
93% possession in the last 5 minutes. We're overrunning them and nothing to show for it yet
We are hammering them and they are shit but I do not trust this team to score (which in itself is mad considering the players we have)
We give these shit teams so much hope. Should be about 3 goals clear now ffs
fred has been rly good
ok im starting to get worried. score please
0-0 at HT would suck
This first half is perfect evidence that Ralf is improving the team but the lack of finishing overshadows that improvement
Telles should take this all fucking day
Finally talked Ronaldo out of taking a FK
# good ref
Good hit Telles.
time flies when we are playing well. It is almost half time
Cmon we need a goal because we'll probably concede in the first 15 mins of the second half
This is insane. Probably xg of 10 or something
Love Elanga taking those throws quickly.
Matic got the best ball control on the team
Matic is making me feel things
Get some cards out ref.
Matic just moves the ball insanely well. Always switching the ball to the side where there‚Äôs least opposition
i like pogba in the white boots
That's a yellow surely
Excellent lindelof!
ICEMAN
That‚Äôs a Pen. He went through him what the actual fuck
Waiting for the Arsenal thread for that penalty decision
Missed Chances FC strikes (or doesn‚Äôt) again!
"Matic has been good, shame we didn't get him when he was younger."
Couldn‚Äôt score a goal.  Great but not so great.
This fucking team is so frustrating. How we're not in the lead is beyond me.
The time isnt even 46th minute yet and we have a ball near their box and he blows it? Lmao the fuck?
It's nice having a mobile defensive pairing for once
"Get Elanga on the ball more and we comfortably win this game. Playing very well, with the control Ralf has been after, just need to finish some chances.

GGMU."
Only thing missing for a good performance is goals! Been a good half so far. Need to be more clinical however in that final 3rd
I'm afraid we're going to lose control in the second half once the intensity inevitably goes down.
Elanga is on fire after his goal against Atletico M.
Im convinced Roy is only in management for the jackets. Can‚Äôt tell me otherwise
Elanga is RAPID
Elanga is fast as fuck boi
"Elanga is faster than Dan James, new vroom vroom"
Bloody hell Pogba drive that one
"Varane, that was beautiful!"
Sancho please
This team is absolutely infuriating.
Why do we always make it so fucking difficult? I cant remember the last time we won a game comfortably.
"Terrific pass by matic there, absolutely terrific"
Matic spraying great passes all over just for it to fo go waste
The positive of having no Rashford is that there is less of a risk of being countered. The amount of times that Rashford makes the wrong decision in the final third and we are open to be countered is obscene.
Man we should beat Watford by 4 goals instead we‚Äòre gonna sweat like a mf till the end
I wouldn't mind seeing Sancho coming in for Bruno. He has had a game to forget.
Ref will give a pen when Liverpool or City plays
Now that's a pen
how is that not a pen? soft but still man
That would have been epic
That's actually a pen lmao
"VAR doesn‚Äôt work, the same refs are monitoring‚Ä¶."
What a pass by pogba
Wow. That touch from Pogba.
How has he missed that??? Brilliant play though.
Fuck me Elanga is taking leaps every week. Potential to be amazing for us.
"Queue r/soccer laughing about ""VARchester United""

What a joke"
That was a stonewall pen we weren‚Äôt given. Fuck this shit
That move was orgasmic omg
Fucking hell what a goal that would've been!
The goal could be the Milky Way galaxy and we‚Äôd still not score
"So close, unlucky! Keep at it, Elanga!"
Attitude be damned... Pogba is world class
That‚Äôs a pen by this seasons standards. It‚Äôs the inconsistency that annoys me.
Foster could punch someone and it still wouldn‚Äôt be given as a pen ffs
How is this still 0-0
"Delicious flick by Pogba, wow"
NOOOOO THAT WAS SO SEXY
Qre we the new Brighton? All xG  no G
It‚Äôs nice to see the most handsome CB partnership of all time again
Ben Foster is gonna have one of a hell video
Elangas movement is what we need up top like that. I like him out there with Ronaldo
The XG must look mad
"Fairly sure that should have been a pen

Pogba to Elanga was filth.

Please don't be 'one of those days'...Weve had half a season of them"
commentator just said that Watford's last six away wins have come under six different managers- that's an insane stat
He‚Äôs gonna take Elanga off isn‚Äôt he
"Can Manchester United score?

They sometimes score."
"if the incoming manager can persuade Pogba to stay, and then consistently get the best out of him, I'd be indescribably happy"
Sancho hat trick
Sancho plz
So frustrating this game...looks like it's gona take one moment of brilliance to win this
Fuck this ref
Secret agent Elanga
what the fuck is happening
What more can Ralf actually do apart from subbing himself on??
"Great outing from Fredo, but do love a nice attacking change."
Ronaldo is frustrated.
"fred was brilliant, unlucky to come off"
Beautiful play shit finishing
"Honestly love hearing old trafford like this, seems like there is belief in the crowd rather than frustration"
A virgin was definitely sacrificed at some point this morning
"Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhaha

WHAT IS GOING ON"
That was funny between Dennis and Pogba lol
Like I'm actually just in disbelief. How can we be THIS unlucky??
Only 2 on target? Bruh.
Commentator keeps calling Sancho Sanchez...
Can‚Äôt wait to see our fucking xG stats after the game
This game has been one big fucking joke.
Are we brighton now
"Jesus people. We are not fucking unlucky, we have shit forwards"
Telles & Matic have been great. Good stuff
Paul Pogba Quarterback edition 4 goals incoming
United playing 2-3-5 formation :)
this is what we call the good old kitchen sink
No Matic is terrifying ngl
How are we not in the lead. God dammit!
Lindelof so good
What is goal?
How are they all so shit at finishing?!?!?
Nah this is crazy
Bruno is not having a good day
has Ralf tried setting the team tactics to Ultra Attacking like you do on FIFA?
Fuck man let's get the 3 pts pls
Overhit crosses FC
"we are the worst crossing team in the premiership

some of these so called ""crosses"" are absolute diabolic dogshit"
Crosses are utter garbage right now
Awful cross.
For the love of god someone in a red shirt put the ball into the fucking net
watford is not even trying to counter anymore tho
Our fullbacks should skip the leg day they are all over hitting the ball
That's the exact same foul as the pen hahahaha ffs
Luke shaw is terrible at sending a ball in
Shaw ffs
getting blueballed so bad
"With Varandel√∂f, I have at no point felt concerned about conceding. Neat."
Pogba looks tired
Pogba looks gassed
Can we stop taking slow throw ins
This team is its own worst enemy.
Could Rashford not have tried to get that ?
what a shift by Elanga. Feeling a late goal here!!!
depressford
"The way things are going, City will humiliate us next week"
Fucking SHOOT IT
"Sissouka falls down, gets back up and gets to the ball before any of our players. That‚Äôs some real FIFA shit right there"
Love watching Elanga and Sancho on the ball. Silky and skillful af
Is Ronaldo gonna beat his no scoring record this season?
Ronaldo gets the ball stuck under his legs so god damn much
Rashy ffs what are you even thinking
"
Again Rangnick gets the team setup absolutely right, but the players let him down with woeful end product."
Absolutely ridiculous
"I feel it was a mistake taking Fred and Matic off.

We look worse after they came offf."
Decent from Sancho. But still no goal
"Great attempt by Sancho. But man, wtf is this"
Arsenall will easily pass United because these guys are so so wasteful it's mindboggling.
Lindelof nice ball to Jadon
3 minute to gain 3 points lads plzzzz
Ronaldo looks absolutely shattered out there
The worse part of this is how insufferable the Arsenal fans are going to be next season.
"Judging by the comments, glad I missed the game tbh... Still hurts tho ffs :("
1 Point against the worst team in the PL
I believed in my very soul that Sarr was about to score that
Manchancester United
Absolute shit. Weak fucking mental midgets
What a shit show fuck off
"Just when we finally had a rare game of total domination, our finishing went completely missing."
None of our players could hit a barn door
Top 4 gone
"Well and truly shat the bed against a team that offered absolutely fucking nothing all game! 

The gap between us and the top teams widens as we continue to improve in one area but falter in several others. Disappointing and shocking that we cant do the absolute basics!"
You could have a budget free agent striker that's 42 years old or one of our random 16 year old youth player that could finish half of the chances created today
"Wow

Not a good wow"
Can't finish. Performance was so much better though
Clean sheet!
Bruno's half time highlights already looked like a calamity of misses
Should've killed the game 12 mins in and been up 2 nil. Instead we drew. Not good enough.
"I guess it's good news for Man United, they have 8 days break."
"This is our best 11, minus Sancho. Could easily be 4-0 up.

Maguire and Shaw should no longer start."
"Absolutely shocking attacking performance. Fans had every right to boo how poo it was.

At least the Varane & Lindelof partnership is solid, hopefully we see it again soon."
Rashford looked like he didn‚Äôt even want to be on the pitch. Pathetic.
"Ronaldo has been pretty good apart from his finishing this half, why are you calling him shit for tripping? lol"
Elanga has been our best attacker imo.
Ronaldo should have gone off at the 70th. Looks absolutely gassed. Not even an outlet at this point.
"Whilst everyone will rightfully criticise Ronaldo just remember Bruno was also incredibly wasteful with chances.

Piss poor."
Ronaldo actually looks finished :(
DDG's distributuon in almost every game is shocking. What was he doing there.
"playing ronaldo as super subs against non-top team will definitely a clutch.

1. he will have the energy  in limited time
2. he will has the thirsty of goal cause it's last chance moment
3. wont be grumpy and probably focus on the game since it's almost end  


playing him start earlier seems wont make any sense, he probably thinks still have another time in 2nd or whatever, waste much energy"
we ain't playing bad and people complaining
Shaw that is not acceptable
Send rashford to a holiday. Dude is down bad
Great improvement lads. 4-1 to 0-0.
It would have been the perfect match for Cavani to come on! Top 4 isn‚Äôt over . We keep going till the end . Keep going . If players want to leave in the summer because we don‚Äôt get too 4 that‚Äôs fine . Leave . We will get back to the top where we belong
"Someone has to point this out.

No Shaw, Maguire, Scott, Rashford and its the best half we have played this season even if we didn't score."
"The fans since their return have been another level, there was definitely a time OT was a bit quiet but it's no longer the case"
"according to this sub, this line up should wipe out the opposition"
"Arsenal are one point behind with two games in hand. Spurs are four points behind with a game in hand and won today. Needless to say, we have to win-win-win."
Let's please win by a couple of goals at least
Ronnie :(
Fuuuck
So close Ronaldo... Just not happening for him in 2022
AWB looking revived.
"What the hell is going on with Ronaldo, he just can't get one in the net."
"Ngl i am really like this start, more urgency"
"I‚Äôm confused by this formation, is Pogba on the right?"
What formation are actually playing here?
I have no clue what our formation is. Pogba and Elanga both seem to be on the right wing
ELANGA IS RAPID
Great save by Ronaldo.
Great voice by the supporters today.
Watford deciding the best defensive strategy is put 11 men infront of Ronaldo
Can't finish FC. Portugal in shambles.
Telles has a very animated running style
"I saw the angle, that ball was 100% going in. But can‚Äôt blame Ronaldo, except for the fact he‚Äôs covering like a big part of the goal"
Brunooooooooo
Come the fuck on bruno.
Bruno pls man
That fkin cyclist
"Ronaldo's touches today ü§å

Great from Elanga too, Bruno should score!"
Ofc foster turns God mode
The amount of easy chances we miss is astonishing.
Ah it‚Äôs going to be one of those days
We are looking a bit more composed
What the hell... Fucking put the ball in the net
Already have a bad feeling about Ronaldo today. He‚Äôs got the face on.
That would have been such a good goal. Curse you cycling gk.
Elanga like a new signing
"Was really selfish by Bruno earlier, Ronaldo had a tap-in"
Need to finish these chances
Should have been 2-0 already
Had to be offside...
Tempo out the back is so much quicker with out Maguire and Shaw
Boo fuck that. Loved the build up though.
Elanga have been on fire!
Elanga doing very well
Elanga is really good
Fuuuuuccck
Wow Elanga is sharp
Elanga is pretty good
Elanga playing really good
That cross from Telles though üòç
"No rash, no maguire and it actually looks good"
I know it‚Äôs Watford and I don‚Äôt want to jinx it but this lineup is getting a decent amount of work done on both ends.
"Elanga is SO fucking progressive. Wow. Makes that dribble across, makes the right decision to pass wide and then continues with a burst of speed to run into the box. Rashford needs to take notes of this, he can do this shit."
"lol, better not be one of those days. Enjoyable match so far."
Should have scored like 4 already
"Even though it‚Äôs only Watford, we‚Äôre playing really good"
Fuck me that was beautiful
Love the football we‚Äôre playing so far.
we need to score before Watford can adapt
Should be 3-0
Need to capitalise on this sloppiness from Watford in the first half because they'll probably turn into prime Atletico at half time
Bruno: the goal is lava
Could actually be 3 or 4-0 in in the first 20 minutes.
We should be on pace for 10
"Holy moly 
Watford are cornered"
Bruno and Ronaldo could have had braces by now wth guys
It's only Watford but for once we're playing like Man Utd
We're so wasteful.
Wow this watford team is absolutely dire.  They arent even playing with energy today
"Should be up 4-0, I really hope this doesn't haunt us in the second half."
Could be 5-0 but besides finishing this is the best we‚Äôve played in a long time
Should really be up at least 2 goals here
The guys gotta do some finishing drills holy shit
wonder if this is the game we play well for more than like 20mins
Is it a 4-2-2-2 with Bruno and Ronaldo as the strikers?
Dropped off a bit. Need to get a goal
"Oh fucking hell that should be in, Bruno."
Ronaldo should have gone down.
We have missed too many chances.
Getting PTSD from Midddlesborough here
Destined to lose 1-0 or draw 1-1. Wasting so many chances
No wonder people dive
"Another game of almost, need a goal to calm some nerves"
We are actually trying to not score I feel
Telles is some player
Should be about 5-0
Bruno is so disappointing in front of goal these days.
"Beyond the cutting edge of a rusty spoon, we look pretty good all said and done."
Matic is on it
"We're gonna get FM'd, aren't we?"
Imagine mctom with skillset of matic
Matic has been a boss.
"Play well, can't score.

Play badly, scrappy goals."
This shows how much we need a DM
Our xG has got to be approaching double digits
"Ronaldo mate, don‚Äôt even think about it"
May have missed but I‚Äôd take that over a blast into the wall
Let Fred take free kicks
"Aarons defending is class to watch, just wish he can drive forward better like dalot"
A young Matic is exactly what we need to unlock this team. Shame there isn't a player like him in the market.
The ball is turning blue.
"Could've been 3-0, minimum. But well get there."
Wan-Bissaka has looked pretty good going forward so far.
Clearly AWB has been learning from Ralf. Dalot took his job for a month. AWB put his head down and went to work.
Watford have been absolute garbage
"The way we've played, plus how wasteful we've been can only spell disaster in the second half.

0-0 or Watford shithouse a goal. It's the only way"
Team looked good. Little disappointed that it‚Äôs 0-0.
Another good half with nothing to show for it
So frustrated with conversion rate
"I think we‚Äôve played well this half. We‚Äôve controlled the game, made chances and we‚Äôve been solid defensively. We should have had at least 3 goals but I think it‚Äôll come in the 2nd half (hopefully)."
"I actually enjoy games like these more despite the 0-0, we're playing well and creating chances. Just need to improve our finishing and it's golden."
"One of those 1-1 games where we dominate? 

Please no."
The subs might turn this game around again
"Played well but should have been one goal at least. Love to see elanga on the pitch, he seems confident and like he enjoys himself on the pitch, more of him please. Matic been solid as well, wish he was a few years younger and we'd have him a lot more in the starting XI. Surely we end this with 3 points, surely..."
Just hope the wasted chances don't come back to bite us
"Midfield with Matic and without Matic is night and day. We are keeping the ball and progressing it up the field with ease. Matic's movement in midfield to open up passing angles is a breath of fresh air after being subjected to Mctominay for so long. Not to mention that he has eyes in the back of his head, somehow always sees a man coming at him and gets rid of the ball in time. 

Without Maguire, not only is the defensive line much higher, but the fullbacks are also going forward a lot more. The defense looks absolutely fearless with this Varane+Lindelof pairing.  

Wanted Dalot to play, but pleasantly surprised by Aaron. In spite of his nonexistent left foot, he has played well. His ball carrying seems to have improved, and he has beat players a couple of times. This is what happens when you keep players hungry and motivated. They improve.

&#x200B;

Bruno has missed loads of chances. Ronaldo missed one or two as well. Elanga missed a half-chance. Games like this are entertaining, but I do worry about Watford scoring the first chance they get and making us look like fools. Let's see what happens in the second half, this is United after all."
Watch us concede from a Foster goal kick or smth.
Matic has been class.
Nice pace from Matic
Pogba what is you doing!! SHOOT FFS!
Lol what was Pogba trying there ?
These boys couldn‚Äôt finish their dinner today
Bruno been shite today
Watford only need one chance and then we‚Äôre chasing a draw. We need to stay sharp
"Another solid game from Matic, too bad he won‚Äôt be able to play another 60 minutes until April.."
Yeah a goal soon please. Bring on Sancho.
Matic making a case for Scott to never start again
Bruno ffs Ronaldo was in then man
"First one wasn‚Äôt a penalty (on Elanga), but that one for sure is.

Edit- yikes. How does VAR not overturn that"
He didn‚Äôt touch the ball
Clear penalty
Arsenal fans gonna put that one in their compilations to post to r/soccer ?
WHAAT A MOVE
Oh fuck off how's that not a pen
Typical VAR against us.
He gets absolutely zero of the ball
best united play in years
"Oh my god, how did that not go in"
Omg what a move
that was fantastic play
Fantastic bit of play that
Holy shit what a goal it could have been
Beautiful seeing Elanga actually beat defenders instead of running straight into them
Fuck that would have been an incredible goal
Unreal from pogba
Elanga is going to become great one day
VAR is genuinely the worst invention in the history of football
You're telling me they watched that in slow mo and decided it's NOT a penalty?????? What the actual fuck
"how did we let Elanga sit in the bench for so long, this guy is amazing."
Someone please score.  We‚Äôve been great just need to close this out
we are playing so good. please someone score
Beautiful play from Pogba
The performance is unreal. Our lack of luck is also unreal
Jesus guys stop acting like gunners this was not pen
"Elanga is absolute class,he knows his positions well and is always asking for the ball,getting into good areas. Quality player"
"When we actually need goals, when we should score more than two, we start missing absolute sitters, get frustrated during the course of the game, lose concentration and let Watford in the game. Classic play from United. 

We need to get our GD up as this will come down to Arsenal, Spurs and us for the final spit and GD could be the deciding factor. 

Score a goal FFS"
Watfords last 6 away wins have came with 6 different managers. That's a stat and a half.
"This has been the best we've played all season, would be such a shame if we didn't get all 3 points!"
Sancho come in baby it‚Äôs your time to seal it
Getting prepared to be fuming after a draw against Watford.
ok this is fucking ridiculous
REF
PLEASE FINISH.
"Yeah, convinced we‚Äôre just cursed at this point."
bruh we are trying our absolute hardest not to fucking score
This ref can fuck off.
lol Watford with the Ole JuJu today. Fully expecting the bar to be hit soon as well as another 3 rejected penalty calls.
"Sancho for Fred, definitely an attacking sub. Here we go"
It's not happening today is it
Ralf's subs have been game changing lately. Hopefully Sancho is another one
We're the new Brighton.
Please score
Still happy that awb crossed
"With how poor Watford on this game, this should be a trashing day"
Matic is playing out of his head today
"67% possession, ffs"
"The plays today have been phenomenal, just unlucky. People need to chill a bit and think about the positives so far."
Pogba is not effective when he's tired and is a bit of a liability. He does his best work in the first half. Would have rather kept Fred on
This is comical
"0-0 written all over this, so infuriating"
god we need a 9.
how do you miss like ronaldo?
I'm so fucking confused man
Alright what city fan put a hex on Ronnie
Poggyback ride
How the fuck have we not scored
If we tie or lose idk what to say
Uh oh Rashford coming on
Bruno and Ronaldo should have hat tricks by now
Any other decent side would be using this game to up their goal difference.
"Going for it, then, Ralf? Ja, sehr gut."
Makes sense since we need to win at all costs
The FIFA United starting lineup
Shaw looking massive
Finishing is painful.
"Ralf, you madman"
Getting flashbacks from the Wolves game United lost 1-0 in the end
That was a lovely cross by Shaw. Shame AWB couldn‚Äôt finish it.
"eager for Ralf to finally say ""fuck it, 10 strikers"""
Score a goal please.
I need a POGBOOM
"How do we have 7 forward in, but only 2 people in the box?"
"Literally can't even act surprised anymore because this is just what happens to us now. 

The simple fact is we have to grin and bear it and dream of better days"
Kevin Friend was willing to let that foul go the dickhead
Elanga so rapid.
Dalot cross from shaw ffa
Literally everyone bar DDG and Varane have taken shots today
 Ow we‚Äôre just crossing
Maguire can't even be scapegoated today. This is the weak mentality of our forwards yet again. Can't handle the pressure of... Arsenal.
AWB BRUH
I see Bruno attending the Marcus Rashford school of decision making.
Pogba looks exhausted
Elanga running more than Rashford who just came on
WTF RASHFORD
Rashford you dummy
Rashford wow
So i‚Äôm guessing we‚Äôve just accepted we‚Äôre not scoring today then
This is aggravating
Bruno & Rashy lol.
Pogba really does look fucked haha
Sissoko has been a pest today
So sick of Rashford‚Ä¶..
Rashford cmi
Sissoko is very solid
Rashford looks so far off being a professional footballer at this level right now.
Elanga has been the main threat today. I feel like he‚Äôs been the only bright spot in the last few matches
"Let‚Äôs not overreact when it comes to Shaw, he‚Äôs just out of form but i think Maguire should be sold."
Just fucking shoot.
All I'm asking for from rashford is just to try how has he regressed this bad
Wtf was that
My goodness wtf was that
CRISTIANO?????
Ronaldo's touch is so fucking bad man. He is so stiff and gets tackled by everyone
This is not what I had in mind when my significant other suggested that we try edging.
Sulking Ronaldo too busy to pass the ball.
Sissoko trips after a run and nobody gets the ball. Shambles
Ronaldo cost us the game
It‚Äôs so sad to sse how much Ronaldo has declined. He‚Äôs a shasow of himself
Why does he clam up in the box like that wtf
Boss needs to have a chat with Ronaldo
fuck greenwood man. if he wouldn't be a fucking asshole than we would have a sub striker..
 The IQ of this team is too low
A good striker in ronaldo‚Äôs place scores a hat trick today
Ronaldo needs a game off here and there. Not even sure we can afford to do that though which is crazy to say
At least Troy Deeney doesn‚Äôt play for them anymore to score a last minute winner and gloat about it for years.
This is a fucking nightmare. No one can shoot.
Shaw walking around like he has two left feet and has played 95 mins
The best attacking players all out on the pitch and they still can't score
Ronnie looks old out there
When will Rashford get dropped completely?
What the fuck is Ronaldo doing. Fucking hell our attack actually stinks and they all are on different wave lengths
Just get it to sancho fuck sake
This is awful.
Is Rashford trying to be this bad? I honestly don't think I've seen someone become this much worse with simply just poor form
90 minutes of us controlling a game with actual good football and this is the result....smh guess we should revert to 15 minute FC
Rashford fresh off the bench and not sprinting‚Ä¶ hes probably the fastest in the prem fuck sake
"Honestly, these fucking players dont even deserve Europa League"
Up until now we've had shit performances and good results. Today it was a good performance and a shit result.
We've had the same number of shots on target lol
Top 4 is lava!
Lindelof distribution üëå
Might be wrong but elanga seemed like the better option
We have wasted so many points in horrid ties.
We should just score an own goal every game and hopefully that'll allow us to finish chances.
I guess there goes top 4.
ALL these players deserve to play UEL next season the way they are finishing
"We have a 37 yo CF starting every fucking game cause our 35yo striker has been injured all season.

From FA cup to PL to Champions League we are burning out both our number 9 and 10."
Useless fucks
Someone please do a welfare check on Roy Keane
What the actual fuck was that from Ronaldoüò≠
Through ball from Ronaldo :)
This team is embarassing  to watch
What the hell is our xG this game. Must be out of this world.
Lmfao just shoot from 40 as the last chance of a horrendous game
*Guts theme plays*
Fuck this shit
We almost lost FFS HAHA
Oh fuck this heroball
What a shit draw.
Just wow
This fucking season. It‚Äôs not even funny.
Should‚Äôve gone into HT at least 3-0 up. Poor finishing today!
We can forget top 4
Bruno has been crap with crosses for a while. Just flat every time
We need a Kane or a Halaand
Can' believe it with so many chances we created
Loving this top 4 is lava game this season
"Top 4 gone with pool, city and spurs to play next"
Simply not good enough.
Bruno lost a goal 1 on 1 with the goalkeeper
"Of course when our midfield finally looks solid during a game, our forwards shit the bed..."
"Dam wonder what happened to Ronaldo, hope he gets out of his slump soon man."
And just like that top 4 gone... bunch of fucking jokers that cant finish their dinners I stg I'm absolutely fuming might as well of taken a loss at this point smh...
JOKE
"Ronnie , rashie and bruno all taking turns to use the ground as a shitter today"
"Don't want Liverpool to win the league, but everton are really doing well against city"
Roman Abramovich just given up Chelsea??
"Another game of missed chances, such a frustrating result!"
Good defending from Ronaldo
"One good thing is, Maguire and Shaw aren‚Äôt playing so we won‚Äôt give away a cheap one"
Ronaldo is so angry at himself.  This is the determination and mindset rashford needs
"Lindelof is good
If that was maguire god forbid"
"What is Rangnick meant to do when these players literally can't hit the target, might have to suit up and show them himself how it's done live lol."
This has a 1-0 loss written all over it
Wtf Rashford
Rashford man wtf
Wtf did Rashford do
Ronaldo is shit
"Rashford barely even resembles a footballer these days, should just move him into Parliament ffs"
"We won't get top 4 and we don't deserve it either.

Arsenal using a very mediocre squad compared to ours and still playing much better football overall. They deserve it tbh, what a shame."
"rashford should press more with his fresh leg, yet he didn't.

and bruno should mindful when take a shot, with 3 peoples in front of him yet hit shot it anyway"
Might be an unpopular opinion. But getting fourth though not impossible seems unlikely now. Our strikers aren‚Äôt taking their chances. And the upcoming games do not necessarily favor our chances. But I‚Äôd want us to be in the champions league or not in Europa league. Not sure what that translates to in terms of the position in the table (8th?). In any case the upcoming fixture list probably helps us do exactly that
Do we not have any striker in reserves? Surely can't be worse than what Ronaldo has been doing.
"Wtf, Ronaldo blocked Bruno‚Äôs goal. 

It was 100% going in."
Rahsford is so fucking bad Jesus fucking Christ
Maybe now people will understand the damage 3 years of a completely incompetent coaching staff can do to young players
people bitch and moan so much on this chat lmao
Bruno shot hits Ronaldo complaining about something
yo this ref can eat a fat dick
Cavani being so fucking fragile is running Ronaldo to the ground at this point
God Bruno is trying so hard but it‚Äôs getting worse and worse. Good pass from Ronaldo after he won the ball (even though this sub says he does nothing)
20 shots. 3 on target ü§£ü§£ FFS
Fucking hell Shaw what a waste
Shaw is crap at crossing. Telles is far superior.
Shaw what in the actual fuck are you doing
lol Ronaldo literally looked like an old man trying to score there wtf
Big Ronnie fan and even I think he's past it. You can't play a number 9 and can't even hold the ball up top.
"I fucking hate this fucking team, it's so tiring to put in the effort to watch every single game for us to get results like this. we did everything right except for the end product and it frustrates me so bad. we've spent colossal amounts of money on top class to be about as useful as a hedgehog in a condom factory. as much as I love Ronaldo, I'm seriously starting to doubt his place in his team, we had so many chances that really just should have been converted but apparently that's too much to ask. same old story, I guess."
Im actually done. We'll be knocked out of CL. PL is finished. See you guys next season.
"Manchester Derby, 2nd leg with Atletico, Spurs then the Scousers."
"Useless. Fucking useless. How much easier do these overpaid whining fucking cunts want it?

\-It's a relegation side

\-You can see they've been coached to a fucking 5-0

\-Multiple times the ball was at their feet and they were directly in front of the goal, in a position where any semi-decent forward would score.

\-At one point we had about 5 forwards on the pitch.

If you can't score here, you want fucking selling. Sick of these shitty performances week in, week out. You can see how much better the coaching is under Rangnick. But these players let the club down week after week after week after week. I gave them so much leeway under Ole because it was clear he wasn't up to it but fuck me, I've changed my mind. Fuck these players, hope they're hanging their heads in fucking shame because Top 4 is gone now. Gone.

I hope Ralf is taking notes for when he moves upstairs and he tells the new manager to fucking sell the lot of them because they aren't good enough."
i really need people to stop saying Ronaldo offers nothing in the build up
people watch ronaldo slip and say he's past it... did you watch the rest of the match?
"It is obvious who has never played the game on here... 

We are playing well guys. Just need to score"
That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre a fucking sub rash
"We had +10 big chances today

Bad luck

Cant blame Rangnick"
"I'm about to explode. My fucking god we're so fucking shit infront of goal. Ragnick is doing a great job with the guys, but players couldn't give a shit."
"Great chance early, Ronnie is pissed he missed that"
"We have to reverse history by beating Watford 8-0, the first 4 is to void their previous 4-0 and the next four is for them to understand to never do that to us ever again."
Ronaldo just blocked it. Lol
"Finishing aside, this has been the best performance of the year so far."
"If they score with their first shot on the goal, I'm going for a walk with my dog."
Fucking Lindelof
"Do you think players are not noticing ronaldos runs or have no faith in their ability to hit the pass?

Many good runs made but no pass made"
If I‚Äôm Rashford I‚Äôm having nervous sweats over this Elanga performance
"If it's any consolation, Garner scored for Forest"
How many 5-0s has Ralf coached so far?
Ronaldo is so unlucky. And he‚Äôs so fed up
Ronaldo can‚Äôt play as a lone striker. He‚Äôs never been played his best as a sole number 9 in all his years at Madrid and Juve. He needs to play as a second striker or winger (he won‚Äôt defend tho obviously)
Chonky telles is not quite as good at free kicks
Ronaldo is an average player at best now. He's so fucking slow at everything.
Dont pass to ronaldo anymore pls
Really haven‚Äôt see. Rashford do one decent thing recently
Our season fucking sucks. Bottom three all gained a point from us
"Embarrassing, really no other word for it"
Bruno been fucking horrendous. So wasteful I can't
"Lads, It is the new history of the Manchester."
Pogba elanga varane lindelof good today
Penaldo/TapInaldo strikes again
Man this thread loves to bitch and moan.
Everyone‚Äôs shitting on Ronaldo but ffs Bruno missed the two best chances of the game
"How can you watch this and think Maguire should start next match. Varane and Lindelof are solid, we're definitely not gettjng that pairing again"
How was that not a penalty on Ronaldo earlier? Honestly.
"I‚Äôm a fan boy, but can we drop CR7 now? I get he‚Äôs the most competitive man on the planet but his negative energy is a terrible vibe for a young team and actually makes me feel uncomfortable."
"Since Rangnick took over, Ronaldo has scored 2 non-penalty goals, which is the same number as Fred, McTominay and Rashford. 

Ronaldo's xG in the PL is 13.32, while he's scored 9 goals, meaning he's significantly underperforming in front of goal in relation to the chances he's had (by 4.32 goals).  

Ronaldo is currently averaging 6.71 pressures per 90 minutes in the PL.  This puts him in the bottom 1% of all forward players in the top 5 European leagues.  

Ronaldo is currently averaging 2.01 *successful* pressures per 90 minutes in the PL.  This puts him in the bottom 1% of all forward players in the top 5 European leagues.  (A successful pressure is defined as when the team wins possession within 5 seconds of the pressure being applied).

There is one stat where Ronaldo is way out in front this season though.  He's been caught offside 25 times in the PL.  Which puts him 6 clear of his nearest rivals, Jimenez, Ivan Toney and Chris Wood.  Perhaps he's trying to compensate for that lack of pace over 5 yards that seems to have deserted him?"
Ronaldo is bribed by Watford :)
For real... Why was Ronaldo just standing still and blocking the shot?
I'm confident that linesman is on our books
Why is Ronaldo standing over this. Fuck outta here
Least shitty free kick in months
Watching matic really makes me wish we had him in his prime in our current squad
"Missed chances or not, this has been a strong showing."
"Elanga has had some moments of brilliance, but I feel like he could be a bit more involved in the match."
I hope Matic has the legs in him to play another 45
Foster's challenge on Ronaldo that made him stumble is a much clearer pen shout than the Elanga one to me. If Ronny goes down we get a pen. This is why players dive.
Take Bruno off for sancho
"Keep Ronaldo on, his movement and link-up has been great today."
Can the model upfront stop whining at every chance?
Is there no young striker like McNeil we can stick on the bench? It's ridiculous that we have to play Ronaldo for 90 mins every match with no other options now Cavani has decided he can't play
"If we‚Äôre lucky, the Manchester derby will be a tie, so this is a *must* win‚Ä¶"
Why call him loser again and again ü§£
The players seem very eager to play in Kazakhstan next season.
Looks like cross and inshallah is back on the menu boys
I prefer Ralf over the players. I‚Äôd rather him get his team he wants instead of half this squad
That's lack of confidence from Rashford
I genuinely wouldn‚Äôt mind never seeing Rashford in a united shirt again. Absolutely useless player
Draw is down to Ronaldo and Bruno finishing being so horrendous. Cannot blame anyone else.
Fuck off sell everyone i am so fucking tired
"Most frustrating 90 mins I've watched, and that's saying something"
There‚Äôs 2 hours of my life I‚Äôm never getting back
"Ronaldo should be dropped. He won't be, but he absolutely should be. He's a net negative on the team and has been for a while now."
"Top 4 not gone yet, just going to need to win the big ones. Real unlucky today"
"now even if ronaldo had the ball in the box, I wont so sure if it's gonna in"
"I know what the problem is, increase the wages! I know they're already being paid millions a week, but they're clearly not satisfied. /s"
"Say a case of good performance bad result. Probably the best we have played under Rangnick in terms of sustained dominance in a game just couldn't find the finish .
3 shots on goal from 22 shots tells a story.

Rangnick has us playing the right way just the results aren't showing yet"
"This handball event in the City-Everton match is a fucking disgrace. Rodri has his arms in an unnatural position, ball hits his hand, but not given. I am baffled"
C‚Äômon warriors go for the kill from early
Fred already misplacing a 5 yard pass to give Watford a counter. Amazing
Fred
Let's keep this positive momentum going lads!
Ronaldo damn it man.
An actually decent ball by AWB!
"Wan Bissaka's crossing is miles ahead of Dalot's. 

Dalot has the dribbling ability though"
SUUUUUUOOOOOO
"I think Ralf can do good things with this team, wish he got more time."
We need to chill with the careless passes.
"I do love how Matic is able to dribble a bit, and always keep the ball."
Wow that Bruno run + fake was sublime!
It's a radical idea but it'd be real great if we stopped ball watching near our goal
Is it Bruno on the left?
Good block by Ronnie
That might have gone in if ronaldo wasn‚Äôt standing in the fucking way
We're wasting chances again
Ah that‚Äôs a crap shot from Bruno
"fuck sakes, that was some brilliant build up too until the finish"
What a build up
Bad miss from Bruno
Didn't realise we were playing Brad Friedel today.
Ronaldo and Bruno missing sitters again‚Ä¶. Like groundhog day this
Leave it to Ben Foster to really turn it up when he goes back to Old Trafford
"Come on, Bruno!!!!!"
Bruno you've got to sink those chances mate
Fuck me what has happened to these guys.
Same shit different day
Hope someone's making a compilation of our missed chances
Jesus Christ our finishing lets us down too much
Every game I watch I find myself asking how we haven‚Äôt scored and that we are so unlucky and it will change.
Please not a repeat of Middlesbrough
That was a good save. Fuckin hell
we should have two goals by now
Imagine Ralf after those 2 chances
Take a shot every time the commentator mentions someone from Watford playing for united in the past
We should be up 3-0
1st season Bruno would‚Äôve scored that with legs tied and eyes closed
"Man, Bruno is very low on confidence. This guy would have scored such goals with eyes closed last season!!"
Even if he's offside that ball needs to go into the back of the net
Sooooo elanga is our best player?
Why do Keepers always turn into god mode when playing against us lol
That move was Fergie era untied.
Elanga lost 2 assists already
RALFIE's REDS
Ronaldo forgot how to twinkle toes.
Ronnie looking frustrated out there.
"i love Paul Pogba and I cant deny, I am going to miss him."
how fucking out of sorts must we have been to get blasted by this lot last time
Offside damn it.
Unlucky ronny
Pitch seems a bit slippery
Lmao ofc offside  when Ronaldo scoredüò≠üò≠ finnaly when he scores
"Elanga playing well, lovely from him there."
Pogba just bodied that guy lol
Elanga is insane. Perfect talent.
Elanga is the breath of fresh air we need. Is there anyone else in the academy we can promote?
No need to be offside there
God that was gorgeous. So bloody close
Amazing play by the team today
"Was the ball from telles 
Was amazing"
Great buildup
Our movement is so good!!
"Elanga‚Äôs movement and pace, wow"
Elanga looking great so far
Elanga has started very well.
Ahh ffs Ronaldo so unlucky
No need for that Bruno. Pogba was right there. Just play him
"ronaldo hits post, bruno should have passed to him and now offside. thats 3 we could have had just from ronaldo."
We are carving them open alot. Just need the goals
Elanga running into space. Inject that shit into my veins. Ronaldo super unlucky.
Fuck! How I wish we had a 25 yr old matic.
Ronaldo goal is coming today.
"Oof elanga so good there, wow"
"Need to start scoring, seen too many games like this where chances and good play leads to fuck all"
"Matic being very good today. Stands his ground. Good passes, have good calm"
Fuck man. This should be like 3-0 already.
"You mean we can actually hold the ball, good game so far"
"   If we took second half FC from Ole‚Äôs last season and mixed it with first half FC from Ralf, we‚Äôd be unbeatable"
Bruno should have hit that with his left instead of trying such a difficult pass
what a cross from elanga
Bruno playing well but making these awkward decisions
"so Elanga is basically Rashford's regen, *the future is now old man*"
"Who put the ball in the Watford net

Who put the ball in the Watford net

Somehow fucking no-one."
Can we put the fucking ball in the back of the net.
"Man, such a good chance, pogba beautiful pass"
So many chances! Got to start taking some of these.
Nice defending Bruno
Right lads we all know how this ends
Fine ball by lindelof damn
Should have been 3 up by now with some decent finishing
I could score some of these chances ffs
We should be 4-0 up. Our finishing has been crap today
i kept hearing the commentator call someone Loser lol
I love Ralf and I can not lie
Can we have pandemic Bruno back please?
Dalot should start. His crossing and quick passing will release Elanga.
One conceded goal and the tempo falls off like a pack of cards
"I am just loving how much attacking we are, the 0 goals are not ideal, could have been 3 up but this is so good to watch."
Ah it's still the first half so the ref hasn't brought his cards with him
Can we sub on Ruud Van Nistelrooy just for this game to get on the end of these chances?
Why are we so bad at finishing?
We played Wednesday so genuinely thought we were on tomorrow. Missed the first 25 minutes ffs
Bruno wtf
Ugb Bruno having a bad finishing game
Yet ANOTHER chance. This is ridiculous
Now he decides not to go down
Fuck this. How many chances can we miss?? This team is so frustrating to watch
Peak Fernandes moment
Today is not Bruno's day it seems.
"When people blame ronaldo 

üëÅüëÑüëÅ"
Fucking hell
Is it time to whip out the Y-word wrt Bruno?
Another great clearance from Bruno!
This gonna be one of them games innitüòê
AHAHAHAHA SHOOT ME
We're so bloody wasteful.
Elanga creating another great chance
Playing very well today. Just too wasteful upfront so far
Matic really good for that chance
Bruno you're fucking killing me today!!
Foster risking it all for the youtube
Ffs man what a poor header. We‚Äôre just wasting these chances
"Oh Bruno, needed to finish that"
"Elanga is making life so much easier for Wan Bissaka, Pogba too. There has been short triangles on the right. I love to see it."
"We‚Äôve squandered so many chances as of late, frustrating"
Ronnie legend
"Bruno gonna assist or score after this shitty performance 
Haha"
Bruno could have had a hat trick
Imagine if matic was like three years younger.
Matic has been class
jesus what's happening
Bruno has been absolutely horrendous at finishing today.
Matic giving a fantastic performance
Hate that we are dominating so much and nothing to show for it.
AWB look like a lost boi in a park
Wan bisaaarker
Why does Ronaldo stand offside for every free kick? Absolutely baffles me
93% possession in the last 5 mins??
Watford is literally parking the bus before the 35th minute. Tells you how much we have them against the wall.
One before the half to keep the spirits up would be good
I think a goal before half would be nice
[deleted]
T E L L E S
Just give telles this one
has the ref been not shit so far? which is a very low bar but I don't remember being annoyed...yet
RONALDO STEP AWAY
"I love Bruno but the number of sitters or good chances he misses whilst converting the bangers is mildly annoying lol.

Still, it's a good game and we'll win this."
Watford has 1 win last 13 . No wonder
"Can't watch unfortunately, how have we looked?"
The fouled pogba almost every time he had the ball with him. What the actual fuck
Matic is so clean with it
When is this ref going to give out a yellow?
Elanga is not a filmer...
"Nah, not enough in that for me."
"This commentator saying ""wan BissARKa"" is really bothering me."
That better be a Yellow at least
How is that not reviewed wtf
Of course no VAR
HE DIDNT EVEN TOUCH THE BALL? HE JUST KICKED ELANGAS LEGS SO HE FELL FUCK OFF WHAT A JOKE PREMIER LEAGUE REFS AND VAR ARE
"This is such a hodgeson team, so pragmatic and shit to play against"
fucking bottlejobs
Matic really shows how lacking Fred and Scott are on the ball. We probably need to sign 2 CMs minimum in the summer.
"Lindelof so good, what a tackle."
Pogba's long passing is unmatched
"We‚Äôre looking good against Watford, but FFS, we should be looking good against a team sitting in relegation.  That we haven‚Äôt scored is abysmal."
these players really need more beatings until ~~morale~~ finishing improves
It will be such a shame if we don't get 3 points in this game given how well we have played
"Super first half, had everything but goals. Should've ended the game already. Team Portugal were disappointing in finishing chances. Need a goal desperately."
"As a team that only seems to play a single half, the second is a concern."
The goals will come.
"Good game from the team, but we need to score in that second half.

So happy that Lindelof Telles and Matic are playing today, they offer more stability."
Pogba is critical for controlling the game
"Game should be over and done with, so frustrating. Would love to see us just convincingly beat someone early on."
Is it just me or is Ronaldo furiously gesticulating every time he's in camera focus?
"Why do I get a feeling we concede another 47th min goal. Oh, to have matic who was 10 years younger. Proper CDM just doesn‚Äôt have the legs anymore"
Looked like a pen
Just bring JAD on.
"I‚Äôd like to see Sancho in early, this is a game for someone like him."
Come on score ffs
Man even matic is balling today.
We shouldn‚Äôt have let Watford even have a chance in this. Should have put this to bed 4-0 at least ffs
That boys got wheels!
"Damn Pogba, was that a shot or cross?! What a ball by Matic too."
Bro.... What is that?
Who needs rashford when you‚Äôve got elanga
Put it on frame at least
Another chance goes begging
Is today the day for a Matic banger? IIRC he's due for one
The difference in ability between Matic and McSauce is quite something
The club really needs to invest in a cryogenic chamber for Matic
Shoulda been 3-4 Nil by half FC checking in
Imagine how expensive Elanga would be if we were trying to buy the dude‚Ä¶.glad we‚Äôve got him.
"shame Matic isn't 5 years younger, he's such a calming presence in midfield"
Bruno wtf man?
Pen?
Fuck off
Woupd be given for other teams
Lee Mason is a cunt
Holy fuck Lee mason is a fucking cuck
That looked like a clear penalty
superb from pogba omg
We can‚Äôt get a call goddamn it. Though Elanga gotta finish that
"Comes through the back of the player and gets nothing of the ball but no pen?

Fuck off Lee Mason."
Howww
"That was amazing, but, yet again, the finishing :("
This finishing will bite us
"i have such a hard on, what a move."
"That is fucking shocking, but who the fuck is surprised."
What is going on!?
No way üò≠üò≠
omg
that was beautiful
What a beautiful combination
Might not be scoring today...
Fucking annoying to see these great chances being missed after such superlative buildup!
Ahh ffs Elanga man should have scored
i just don‚Äôt understand how we can‚Äôt score after creating so many chances
Great touch but poor finish from Anthony
Elanga is simply our best youth prospect in a while.
How ffs how
One goal ffs.
the sort of move that there's literally no defence against
"Elanga is playing fantastic, fucking gutted he didn't finish that."
Everything but the finish ommgggggggggg
Beautiful play. Although we haven't scored I am enjoying this 11.
Genuinely one of our best performances in yeeeears
Any place to check live xg?
Pogba has been good today
Fred is too deep. Not sure we need two midfield players at the back at all times
Blocked
This is unbelievable
Our best lineup most games I still think is Pogba LW and Sancho on the right
Fuck off comeonnnnnn
No way
"Perfect, Sancho in"
Ronaldo is cursed
This team just can‚Äôt score.
Absolute meme football
Elenga lol
Jeez the bar for Utd strikers is on the floor since Ibra left
How is that not still in?
That's a brave substitute and I believe this game is a must win given our coming run of fixtures.
"We don‚Äôt really need to change the tactic, it‚Äôs working but we just can‚Äôt finish. Fred off for Sancho is a big change"
They were blocking that anyway. 2 Watford players right there
Sancho to pull an Elanga and score from his first touch.
"MORE XG!!!!!


What a pass from Bruno though"
goddamn rangnick ballsy sub
Hopefully Sancho can change this
We could have Ronaldo and Messi and still struggle to score. We have the Tottenham curse.
If I wasn't supporting us I'd have a lot more fun watching us. Because finishing aside this is beautiful football
"25 Minutes left. Come on ffs, we gotta score!"
Great play from AWB
We are much better at breaking down the low block and creating chances. That is undeniable.
Jadon please be angry and do bits.
Elanga > Stoneworker Bluechip
Fred off and Matic with 60 minutes played. That is some risky business.
Hodgson using all his old trafford juju
At least they didn‚Äôt come out of half time and concede
Elanga tracking back love to see it
I hate to say this but i‚Äôm just expecting the inevitable Watford goal any minute now
FUCK OFF
OH MY GODDD
I can't cope
Luckily Pogba is gonna score today.
What happened there
Pogba carrying a Watford playing.
Paul happy to carry any team!
Wtf was that ü§£ü§£
Pogba wearing Dennis
Dennis testing out his MMA skills
HOOOOWWWWWWW
Pogba with beast mode initiated
Pain. Pain. Pain.
Honestly it's unbelievable we're not 1-0 up at least
When are we going to put a ball into the net ffs!!
This is so annoying üòÇ
The fuck is this? How are we still 0-0. Do they have allergy to the goal?!
Sancho is such a liquid footballer
"Just one, all we ask."
Imagine if Rashy scores it after having a shit game on Wednesday.
"Going by recent games, I'm not going to call any substitution shit until the end of the match."
Sums up Ronaldo
"20 odd minutes left still, still believe we wil score"
Matic??? So what‚Äôs the formation now?
Taking off Matic could be a very big mistake.
A draw is a loss. It has the same affect. Ending the season.
I don't think Matic deserves to go off.
Rashy off the bench will score
Bold move subbing matic out...
Rashford is the new ole let‚Äôs go
"This is like a real life version of the ‚Äúwould you rather play well and not win, or play badly and win‚Äù debate."
"We have nothing to lose, good call. A loss is the same as a draw"
Love this from Ralf. Taking risks!
4-0-6 formation. Gotta love it
It's the 4-0-6 formation!
"Lol with all the attackers on field, if we still cant score, i don't know what to say."
I can see this backfiring and leading to 1-0 Watford
"Look at the difference Matic makes when he‚Äôs on it and the club hasn‚Äôt thought that it would be a good idea to sign a top quality 6 player  who can play week in week out , if anything we've made the problem worse"
Not sure about Matic coming off. I think Watford might grow into the game now
4 2 2 2 back on the menu bois
"Pep would play with 10 midfielders if he could. 

Rangnick now wants to play with 0."
Everybody wants a chance to miss
"AWB attacking crosses better than our forwards now.

We're never going to score today, are we?"
Yeah this season is cursed lmao
Nice from AWB there
We need the fans energy
Bro Wan-Bissaka wide now wtf
Bruno has been so poor
Xg off the charts
Ronaldo should take that frustration out on the ball
Great movement from Bruno.  Shit everything else
fifa scripting vibes
I will never understand how that isn't obstruction on Elanga there - no attempt to play or even shield the ball by the defender - just pushing Elanga away...
We are to chalk this off to one of those games. I don't see a goal for us. I can bet my life savings on it.
Hope ref gives 7 minute‚Äôs of extra time like every city game
"Ralf be like ""Should I substitute our defenders off for strikers lads?"".

These numpties are so far letting him down today."
When goal?
Too tight for Shaw.  Should have curve and a bit slower. Easier said than done.
Who tf are these watford players üòÇüòÇ
Wtf was that free kick
I trust Ralfs subs.
pls score
"It‚Äôs not even like they‚Äôve defended brilliantly or Foster has had a blinder , we've been so damn wasteful"
Bruno taking the instant turnover as if he has any midfield behind him
WHAT ARE U DOING RASHY
Rashford lol
How/why did Rashford not get that?
These Bruno wind-ups are killings me
He fell and still got to the ball first wtf
Rashford‚Äôs progression has most certainly stalled. Little improvement for what? 2-3 years?
"Oh well, goodbye champions league next year. Arsenal is going to take 4th place with our ides of march approaching"
I don‚Äôt remember the last time Rashford had an impact for United. This sucks man. I wish we were in form and thrashing teams 4-0 and dominating :(
Jesus what a waste of an opportunity
Ronaldo‚Ä¶
"Just think, in a parallel universe there's a Marcus Rashford that made his Pen in the Euros and is leading United in a title challenge this season,  garnering praise from strike partner CR7."
Thank god Watford are shit
Rashford's movement was shit for that defending attempt
Sema is a bit of unit
We look gaasd
Ronaldo is done
Ronaldo is so done
Wow
"Half of them look completely fucked. I missed most of the match, lots of running?"
We‚Äôre playing with 10players with ronaldo now
"Really need to stop putting Man Utd on my coupon lol. Makes everything 10x more stressful, would be up 80 quid if they win"
So many attackers on the field but can't even get a shot on target right now.... Please
Fucking sissoko falls gets up and gets the ball yet i get downvoted for saying that having no midfield is a mistake. Ridiculous
This is pitiful if they come out with a tie
Desperate for a striker
"We desperately need another striker on the bench. Ronaldo isn't looking sharp and we have absolutely nobody else to replace him without Cavani. 

Best option would be Rashford *I guess*"
Ref has a 0-0 on his coupon...
Something HAS to come off.... surely????
Sissoko is everywher
We need a striker
Bruno wasting maybe our last chance there. Great job
Are we losing points to WATFORD üòîüòîüòî
We've absolutely fucking shat the bed by not being able to put in basic shots into the back of the net.
can't believe we're gonna draw this game after all thise opportunities missed
Ronaldo piss poor
We need to build the team around Sancho.
"If there was a trpjy for draws that should have been easy wins, we'd end our trophy drought"
Yeah this games over
Jeez we don't even deserve Europa if we don't win this
"Opposition are rattled. Right, pass it slowly to each other and then drift an over hit pass into the box. That‚Äôs what we should do."
Watdord conceded 6 goals in the final 90. Come on boys. It‚Äôs Fergie time!
All good lads. Who needs top 4 when you‚Äôre shite.
Welp. Kiss top 4 goodbye lads.
We have had 1 convincing performance this season.
We got downgraded from 1-1 draws to 0-0
jfc we cant stop hitting them with crosses and passes  wtf
"3 minutes for time wasting and subs, okay."
That goal kick took 50 seconds to take by the way
"I mean if we're gonna miss all of these chances and in the end we're gonna play like shit, how is it even possible."
Useless fcuks all of them.
That's top 4 gone then
WHAT ARE THEY FUCKING DOING
gg FFS
I honestly doubt if they score with11 cones instead of Watfprd players
Someone shoot wtf
"Fucking brain dead performance, idiotic"
What a mother fucking game. Sucks
Top 4 gone
Booooo
I don't blame anyone but myself for staying up for this shit
How in tf did we draw this?! Looks like top 4 is out of reach now
Anyone got a spare world class striker?
"Now we somehow have to win against City, Spurs and Liverpool in a row. Fuck me"
Sad to see Rash becoming tRash
Compared to our last game out against them there's a lot of positives but when you keep wasting your chances you get these results.
We‚Äôre glorified Brighton
That was infuriating to watch
"Completely dogshite. Atleti must be kicking themselves. Apart from Sancho, Elanga and Matic there‚Äôs nobody else who deserves to wear the shirt"
Missed the game today. Any positives?
Clean shit?
Another draw. Lovely.
"I was ready to celebrate a refreshing performance, I was sure it was only a matter of time before we scored. Somehow, these players have missed every single chance. I could skull 10 pints and put away some of these sitters. 90 minutes of pure domination with 0 goals to show for it. Get a fucking priest into Old Trafford and exorcise this cursed club."
"I can't stop thinking about Man United's decision not to sign players in January, did the club make the right choice?"
That's not a penalty
At this point you just cant blame Ralf.
Ronaldo is past it.
Stupid Bruno.  Stupid shit decision.
Ronaldo is our only striker. After spending a billion on players we have 36 year old lad playing number 9 every fucking week.
We need someone else to play striker. Ronaldo‚Äôs legs are gone. He got so much service today and wasted it all. Shame no one else could Finish either. Really great performance for us.
Yeah Ronaldo is not that guy anymore. Look past the nostalgia
Criminal that our midfielders get subbed so Ronnie can stand perfectly still in the box.
"Lindelof >>>>>> Maguire 

maguire wouldnt even dare to commit that tackle like Lindelof did"
Bruno's terrible finishing is kinda upsetting
So sick of De Gea's weak ass passes. These have put us under pressure too many times.
Well at least he didn't hit the wall
Thats a pen. I dont understand football anymore
"please, a Bruno assist for CR7 just so I can enjoy knowing how many naysayers there are here"
Shaws crosses are trash
Can we stop playing for fucking Cristiano? Fuck this ego shit. Not every ball has to be for him
"For all the sulking, Ronnie has been pretty shite today. We need a young striker next season y'all."
Don't shake your fucking head when you're missing sitters
Bruno has been crap today! Wasted so many chances
I‚Äôm so sick of watching Ronaldo whine.
I don‚Äôt want to sound negative but I don‚Äôt think we are going to win the league this season
I'd love to see Ben Foster's smug smile wiped from his face today.
Sheesh David is a liability with the ball at his feet
No goals yet but we are playing awesome
FERNANDES ANOTHER SITTER MISS
"I wish I was confident that this version of Pogba would stick around, on his day he just elevates this team to a new level"
Games like this that piss me out about Cavani
Ronaldo should have went down!! A free penalty haha
Ronaldos the best crosser in this team
Bruno's movement is looking sharp. Think that header is a tougher finish than it looks. It is a bit above him
Bruno couldn‚Äôt finish his fucking lunch. Jesus Christ lad
Wan-Bissaka‚Äôs fade is far too high
Watch Watford score within the first 10 minutes of the second half now.
Bruno might be the most erratic player I've ever seen. He makes the hard stuff look easy and the easy stuff look hard.
"If this isn‚Äôt a pen, what is?"
Ya'll are crazy if you don't think Pogba cant succeed here. The dude just needs support. Beautiful play and Elanga shoulda scored.
"0-0 draw, not getting 3 points further solidifies us not making top 4"
Ronaldo is very offf form
Moyes vs crossing against Fulham vibes
Fucking hell Rash.  What was that?  Maybe‚Ä¶try to get a toe on it?
"2 shots on target so far!
Ronaldo, Bruno, hang your heads in shame."
These players don't deserve to play Champions League next season
Why the hell did Rashford just leave the ball?
Fuck Ronaldo this game. Absolutely shit
Bye Bye Top4
Top 4 is now entirely in Arsenals hands.
Ronaldo has been awful since RR has been here..
Rashford having his Delli Alli moment
This has been the worst Ronaldo game I‚Äôve ever watched
Fucking hell with that selfish long range shot.
I TOOK A MENTAL DAY OFF OF WORK FOR THIS?????
Players trying to pass to Ron everytime
"Yeah City up next, goodluck with that"
Attackers should be embarrassed with themselves.
Bruno should‚Äôve either buried his chance or should‚Äôve passed it to Ronaldo. I can‚Äôt with this team delivering 2/10 performances every week.
"we got a youth replacement for rashy in elanga n now we need one for ronaldo‚Ä¶ 

sancho- academy striker - elanga

yeahhh i have a dream !"
Ronaldo is finished
Anyone else feeling completely disconnected with the team? Even us under Moyes didn't make me feel like this
PASS THE FUCKING BALL BRUNO!  What bullshit.
"Mfs complaining about Bruno now. He has been really good, all teams miss such chances, problem is today is the first time we are creating chances like a top club."
Ronaldo and wall is gonna meet once again
Our backline looks so much more calm and relaxed without a jittery Maguire and the midfield more productive without McTominay.
Shaw getts paid a lot of money to make crosses like those.
"Ronaldo has really declined since he joined us. His legs look fucked, no balance and no composure."
"Bruno has an incredible game so far, running his ass off in both defense and attack. And people wanna sub him off and take his captaincy away because he hasn't scored on a few chances? Fuck off and enjoy that we're playing well for once."
Ronaldo is officially out of form
"Bro y‚Äôall yanks who have never played football need to stfu. Ronaldo has done everything well apart from finishing, created great chances for fernandes etc. Dude is just hella unlucky today. Y‚Äôall need to support your players, we are playing well and are bound to score at some point"
Ronaldo's legs don't keep up with his brain anymore.
Bruno is a fucking idiot
"I HATE THIS FUCKING TEAM! EVERY FUCKIN TIME WE HAVE HOPE, THIS BUNCH OF PRICKS HAVE A WAY TO BRING ME CRASHING BACK TO REALITY!! 
Good god, Ronaldo is fucking done. Playing like it's his testimonial. Horrific on the ball and is just not up to it. He ain't the biggest problem but we're essentially playing with 10 men with him up front. Get your fucking finger out Cavani and get the fuck back into the team!! Rant over."
"rangnick should use ronaldo as late subs, he will have energy to run and thirsty of goal in limited time"
Bruno in this left/free role has looked really good so far. He has made some excellent runs
Ronaldo did sign for city.
Fred 3 giveaways in 3 minutes.
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a team as bad at crossing as we are. It‚Äôs baffling
This is painful to watch.
Ronaldo washed fr. Needs to retire
"Shaw never ever overlaps bro he‚Äôs so lazy , I can see why he drove Joee up the   wall."
God I wish Cavani was playing
wtf AWB put in a dangerous cross and it doesn't result in a goal ffs
Ay thats the cycling gk innit
Great opening 10 minutes. We are better without Rashford. Period. It‚Äôs sad but true
"Brilliant play, loving this attitude/energy from our team! They have fight in them today üí™üèº"
"Given the form rashford is in

The ball would never have gotten to bruno"
"Has no one here watched Ronaldo play the last decade?

He is very animated on the pitch, it's not an attitude problem."
Time for Foster to play his annual Prime Yashin game today?
Watch them score a fluke goal now despite our domination
Bruno and Ronaldo are literally United‚Äôs worst finishers atm Jesus Christ lol
Watford sleeve sponsor is dogecoin? We really can‚Äôt lose to these lot lmao
We couldn‚Äôt deliver a cross if we worked for an evangelical post office
This honestly just feels like Middlesbrough part 2. Easy chances that our forwards just aren't taking.
To soft for pen
"Nah, soft"
This team is an enigma. We've been living off scraps for years capitalising on the one or two chances that we got. Now that we're creating lot's of chances we can't finish.
"Man I wish we get a player like Matic, he‚Äôs amazing at controlling the midfield but he can‚Äôt play for too long."
"So another striker must be in the works for the summer window, yeah? Cavani and Martial most likely gone, Scum hopefully in prison, and Ronaldo can‚Äôt be the only option up top."
How is that not a penalty?
"Clear penalty - VAR looks at penalty - no, that's fine :)"
Blocked by United
Eriksen is playing for Brentford
How many goals can Haaland score if he plays for us with this current system?
If that first chance goes in off the post we win this by 4 or 5 goals
The only thing rashford has done right this season is finish. It might be time to bring him on
Here comes Rashford to stand there until the ball gets to him and then dribble into a wall of defenders
"Ronaldo would be an amazing option to be bringing off the bench right about now.

He should not be playing 70+ minutes against Watford. 

If we had a top class, prime CF, we could save Ronny as a super sub and for CL nights."
"What the fck are we doing, Watford already playing as awful as they could but we still cant score."
Ralf going to be telling Fletcher to get into a kit.
"Rashy, that was yours"
Rashford is honestly so shit‚Ä¶ he hasn‚Äôt had a good match in two seasons now
That was great pass by Sancho wasted by Rashford
Holy shit Rashford isn‚Äôt pressing and his passes and touches are horrible.  He‚Äôs got the freshest legs‚Ä¶
"Fuck this we sacrificed fred, matic and pogbas creativity to keep ronnie on the field?"
no more rashford rest of season
Relying on Ronaldo too much every time he is on the pitch. Players always look for him.
Bruno‚Äôs all decisions were shit today.
"Only three minutes?

Pisstake. Not surprising after the penalty call though"
Much less confident about atleti coming to Old Trafford now
Bruno with another selfish shot
Ronaldo just stopped moving ~85 minute
"Fucking humiliation, shocking performance. Rangnick can only do so much, the players let him down."
We need a top striker and defensive midfielder this summer or we might not even get into European spots next season...
22. Chances created. Teams in relegation battle are tough
"Cristiano Ronaldo Premier League 21/22:

Appearances: 23

Non-penalty XG: 11.8

Non-penalty goals: 7

&#x200B;

That is... disgustingly bad finishing"
"People saying Bruno was awful don‚Äôt have eyes.

Should he have scored? Yes.

Did he create like 3 or 4 clear goal chances? Yes.

Did he organise the press and the midfield? Yes.

Did he run his bollocks off like usual? Yes."
Ronaldo was poor at the end of the half but how are you guys hating this performance? He scored 1 which was just off and hit one on the post from that angle. Linked up quite well in creating Fernandes chance as well. How the fuck you ignore all that. For the first 20 mins he was the most involved player imo.
"What is point of Ronaldo in this team? i feel like i have to ask this question a lot recently, why is he suddenly undroppable with performances like this?"
Wait you people actually think it‚Äôs Ronaldo‚Äôs fault his own team mate blocked his shot? Lol
Willian on a free > Rashford
Pogba spraying world class passes than tracking back with half the effort of Van Nistlerooy is so fucking frustrating to watch.  He has all the ability but none of the mentality.
Ronaldo is finished
Time to drop Ronaldo for a bit. You can tell that everyone is scared to upset him and it affects their decision making in the final third. Hesitating to shoot or even go for the ball out of fear that he‚Äôll throw a temper tantrum and point at his feet after they take a shot.
Elangas shot might end up in Kiev
"Cr7 is done
....."
can we finally bench ronaldo after this game? dude is horrible Its better to give some academy lad instead of this walking fuck up
Again this sub is just kids being reactionary
wtf Ronaldo!
This Ronaldo dialogue every time he loses his footing or is dispossessed is actually nauseating. Super tiring
Another draw against a team we should have smashed. Not finishing top 4 with all those teams below us having games in hand.
The only urgency Shaw has is when he's eating
"Commentators criticising Pogba for not working hard enough to get back, but not mentioning AWBs shocking pass to noone"
Rashford ass
"Rashford is just soooo dumb 
Wow"
Ronaldo is trash
I shouldn‚Äôt have woken up at 8 to watch this shitfest
One of the most expensive sides ever assembled. Yet somehow mid table quality.
Ronaldo needs to fuck off in the summer
"""RoNaldO iS nOt tHe prObleM2"""
"Fuck the players. Fuck them. You can see how much better we're coached, they've had the chances to make it 5-nil, we have about 5 attackers on the pitch, it's against a relegation side. If they legit can't score 1 goal here then I want to see a clearout in the summer."
We all know this sub will start praising Ronaldo again as soon as he scores a tap in next game.
Ronaldo fanboys will keep saying he's not getting enough service but he's been awful for weeks.
Wow AWB üëè
De gea my god
Bit tiring seeing Ronaldo shrug now he's my favourite player but his shrugs and not going to applaud and thank away fans pisses me off
"Could have passed it to Ronnie for a tap in, but should finish that chance regardless."
Nice to see rashford and shaw dropped
Someone give Bruno a stamp card for his missed sitters. At this rate he surely can claim for some rewards
Fuck that was so nice but offside
All of these missed chances are going to come back and bite us if we don‚Äôt capitalize soon
I did not think I‚Äôd be saying this but wan bissaka has impressed me the past two games. Looks much more comfortable with the ball.
Woy Hodgson looks well tbf to him
Hopefully it's not one of those games that we play so well just to lose at the end.
The amount of clear cut chances that Bruno makes me question my sanity
"Bruno is like Rashford last season, putting up numbers but overall play has fallen off"
"Bruno's work rate has been brilliant despite his squandering. Hope he gets one in, he deserves it."
Please can we let Telles take this one?
Should have subbed Mata on to take the FK.  üòú
I see the one-eyed refereeing has begun...
Man if this game was 4-0 now I would've switched it off and got my ass kicked in Elden Ring
Did he actually get the ball ? I didn‚Äôt think he did
Need a new striker for sure. Should have bought backup ighalo type striker in Jan
combine chances under ralf and finishing under ole and we're the best team in the world
"2 Bruno involved goals second half, I feel it. One assist one finish."
Cristiano Offside Ronaldo
"Ronaldo ü§ù Rashford
Always being offside"
Fuck me Ronaldo lives offside
I‚Äôve been waiting for a Pogba Juve screamer since we‚Äôve signed him ü•≤
Shoot you eejit.
Fred getting megged in a key defensive area because he just goes flying in daftly. Stay goalside!
Need to sub out Fernandes. He has been awful today. Need Sancho in.
Should be a pen tbf
5v1 what else is gonna happen? Nobody supported pogba in the box.
These refs are not good.
This defies belief. Now we are blocking our own shots
Would like to see Elanga pushed up next to Ronaldo for five minutes
Wtf has happened to Ronaldo‚Äôs finishing?? Mindblowing that he can‚Äôt finish anything
RR‚Äôs substitution is a form of art.
Luke almost turning into peak David Beckham.
Laaaaazy pogba
Pull the trigger Rashford!!
Rashford?
Did rashford refrain from shootin???
Come on Marcus
Is it his eyes? Does he need glasses? What the hell?
How the hell did Rashford not reach that?
that was bad from ronaldo
Awful. Awful. Awful. Everything is awful.
For fuck sake Ronaldo
Ronaldo literally is only a box player now. Can't dribble or cut at all. Just can score taps ins
Ronaldo needs to be dropped surely
Rashford literaly stood still never offered a pass for sancho. Man he really is not very smart at playing football
"Lifting that Ukraine sign up made the lot of them tired, this is tragic"
Sancho at least in good form
Love Ronaldo but hated him in this match
delete the club
This team is actually fucking useless. We have been squandering so many chances this season it is actually mad. Rangnick has done his job and it is the players that are letting him down
There's zero chemistry amongst the squad. One can only imagine the locker room atmosphere.
[deleted]
"Im sitting here watching the stream while chanting Rhythm is dancer, what an addictive chant ! Lets fucking go boys !"
"That warfortd player threw the bottle on the pitch, this ain't your mum's stadium mate üò§"
I hope we pummel them for Ole!
"With Matic in today, looking forward to seeing Bruno not having to come back so deep for the ball."
"Delicious first touch from Ronnie, I was ready to jump!"
AWB with a good low cross?
So close man
Matic is surprisingly nimble ngl
"Corner jinx is broken, goal anyone?"
Gaping holes behind our strikers.
Ronaldo ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
What in fuck was Ronaldo doing to not dodge it
The way Ronaldo just stood after getting smacked by the ball at 100 kmh üíÄüíÄ
What is the crowd singing?
Ffs every opposition GK turns into prime Neuer when they face us.
C‚Äômon
Dammit
Please don‚Äôt be one of these fucking take the piss in front of goal games again
Ahhh so it‚Äôs going to be one of those games
Bruno wtf man
Our finishing is actually now on level of worrying.
Lol we're so fucking shit at finishing am dead.
"Is it one of those unlucky days? I remember two, vs Fulham I think in 2003 or 2004 (Van Der Star game) and Arsenal FA cup final in 2005."
You need to bury those chances!!!!
Elanga is rapido
How the fuck...
xG FC
"After all these misses it's certain this is ending in a draw

Goodnight"
I'm so proud of Elanga from that attack alone
Any idea why sancho is on the bench today? Felt he was finally hitting his stride and was playing really well in the past few matches.
Elanga has been robbed of two assists already.
Two mega chances already. Bruno has to score (offside depending).
All those wasted chances. I'm scared.
"Just an absolutely awful finish 

Waist high right where the keepers hand is"
Ofcourse he turns into Kahn against us
Don‚Äôt worry guys. We‚Äôre not the type of club that lets early missed chances come back to bite us.
That‚Äôs like 3 clear chances missed now
Bruno used to be so clinical.
Bruno wtf
my fucking god our finish again :( WHYYYYYY
HAVE TO FUCKING SCORE
We going to win this game for sure
"The recent run of games has definitely affected Cristiano's body, Cavani really needs to come back and rotate with him"
Hope the missed chances don‚Äôt haunt us back later
"Matic makes a world of difference, I don't think just one midfielder like Matic is enough in the summer window"
Telles should have given it back to Elanga tbh
Fuck
We are 200% cursed
"I don‚Äôt know what happened, but we definitely are a more selfish club this year.  So many missed opportunities because we don‚Äôt lay off or support each other."
So close
Wow our next few fixtures are going to be massive
Offside bruh
Should be 3-0
"Should have been easily 2-0, but we're playing well!"
It was a good move at least. Definitely off though
FFS
Brilliant from Elanga and Telles
Elanga is so much better then Rashford it‚Äôs not even funny
"sure that's offside?

isn't his shoulder only offside"
"Nil-nil, but great stuff so far"
"Excellent build up, it will come."
No reason to be offside
Elanga is so good involved in everything
Elanga is playing with so much confidence
Fuxxkkkkkkk meeeer
Brilliant there from Elanga
Should be 2 nil already
"Started really well, enjoying this, let‚Äôs get a goal boys."
"We've had a could really good chances so far, but I don't want to jinx it"
We could be a few goals up rn
idk man just a shoulder
Elanga is easily our best player
I really like Fred-Matic midfield
Elanga 11 I beg
Good build up. Good finish. Good offside decision.
Ronaldo has like 5 offside goals this season lmao
Elanga is carrying our attack
Elanga has been playing so well
What a run by Elanga
They are here for the taking
"We must score soon lads, keep calm"
Worried Elanga would be quite limited on the right hand side but still looks as energetic as usual wow
This is pretty stuff
Need to put one of these chances away. If Watford shithouse a goal it could put us off
playing sexy football but put it in the back of the net please
Elanga they have families.
I thought it was a half a yard for the striker as the new rule?
"We are doing whatever we want, except scoring."
I keep forgeting that Cleverley is still playing there
"Fred occasionally does show the Brazillian in him! Improved after a poor start, that interception a few moments ago was class too"
Fuck sake we aren't taking our chances here
"It's going to be one of those days, isn't it?"
How many chances
Ffs
Bruno plox
This could be 5-0 ffs
Hope we won‚Äôt display our fatigue in the second half
Should/could be 3-0 up.
We should be up 4 goals
"Please score, Bruno."
Bruno needs to drop his shoulders and have fun instead of getting more and more pissed.
Our finishing has been dogshit for some time now.
im just happy to see us performing well
What is happening??
"Pls sm1 score, so many chances we are creating"
Should be atleast 2-0 up
"When Pogba delivers a silky pin point ball to your feet, you need to fucking score."
"We should be winning this by 3 or 4 already,  but you know what will happen..."
"easy 4-0 it should be, but im loving the performance"
What the actual fuck Bruno
"Apart from the 3 or 4 sitters we've wasted, it's been a really good opening 20 minutes for us. Some great linkup play, and in total control so far."
Our xG is like 10
This start reminds me of the Sir Alex days!
One of these chances is going to be converted soon right? Beautiful set up play so far but such bad luck on the finishing
"Should be up by more than one and it is important we get at least 1 before half. Come on lads we have dominated so far, apply that finishing touch!"
That‚Äôs a wonderful clearance from Bruno there
We‚Äôve been very good so far but really need a goal soon.
"We are playing fantastic, but the finishing can't be this bad or we'll pay for it."
We've been brilliant. Just the finishing letting us down.
Waiting for Ben Foster to turn into prime Neuer next
Watford are so poor. should be smashing them.
They are chasing this game so hard.  Going to be exhausted by the 60th.
please bro
GEGENPRESSSS?
Hope Sancho is subbed in at for the last 30min. He could do really well I think.
We can‚Äôt score
Jesus fucking Christ so many chances
Pastor Fred is blessing us once again
Oh my god Bruno how many chances will you miss
Bruno... im so damn speechless man...
"We are looking fuckin good

Just need that final finish."
Fred's passing has actually been great today or am I imagining things
Oh so it's going to be one of those days
bruNo wat?
WTB a proper finish PST.
Fernandes pls score ty!
"Painful, when you see them play well, but miss all the chances"
And all of this will be forgotten when he gets an assist
What the fuck is going on‚Ä¶
Arre yaar Bruno
Penalty?!
Shades of Middlesbrough match this
I‚Äôm not too worried that we‚Äôll win. Once they finally put one in the net I bet the floodgates will open
Bruno c'mon man!!!
When you put all your XP into build up play and gegenpress
"With all the chances we are creating and wasting, looks like gonna be 1-0 match, we scoring at 88th min."
"Genuine question, which CB position Varane used to play when he was at Real Madrid?"
We are cursed today.
Hit the target!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lidelof and Varane should be our CB pairing moving forward. Maguire should not be starting over either of these guys.
I don‚Äôt know if we are playing good or Watford not even interested in playing
So many chances but this team just can‚Äôt score.
Another one!
The ghost of Brad Friedel will haunt us today.
Matic look so mature calm and collected ita so nice to see it in our midfield
Wtf is Pogba doing lol
Hopefully when one goes in the floodgates open
Matic is so smooth
Honestly matic is a breath of fresh air at holding mid
I cannot stand corners that done get past the front man.
"Fucking hell, its like our players don't want to score!!! How its not 2/3 nil I don't know!!!"
Our refusal to get back onside is infuriating
Even the AR thinks we should be ahead
Garbage freekick there
I‚Äôm convinced that everytime I see watford half of their team is new‚Ä¶ Ive barely heard of any of these
Sissoko is such a powerful unit
We aren't taking our chances. Not good.
Great shot by Fred
I‚Äôll take one goal please.
No other team manages to play so well and still keep it at 0-0.
Matic is amazing against slow teams
Please not Ronaldo.
No rowalldo no
Well at least Telles took it.
watford are just shit
"10 attempts. 

1 on target."
Just get me a Matic regen
Will we score?
Not saying this was a pen but I have seen them called for less ‚Ä¶
I think he got the ball but went through Elanga so should've been a pen. Need to see more replays though
This commentator is doing my head in saying Wan Bissarka every time
Fucking wasteful
"Lindelof should be starting, end of discussion."
We played so well... But it's fucking 0-0.
kevin friend has such a punchable face
Good performance but nothing to show for it
Can anyone tell what the pin Ralf is wearing says?
Why tf is everyone slipping
Seen so many slips today pff
Team Playing well
I honestly dread the second half because Kevin Friend will find a way to fuck us
"This game should be dead and buried.

Very go performance but Jesus christ the lads up top need to be putting those chances away."
I know he's rested this match but I reckon Sancho would have a goal by now
Any idea what's up with McT? He missed the Atleti game too
We'll need two today! We just know their first shot on target will end up in goal
Pretty sure that went out but what a run by Elanga
Now Pogba joining the party
That didn't look clearly off to me
If ronaldo hit the near post faster it's a goal. Rapid from elanga
"Learn tominay , learn"
Shoot that pogba!!
This has been comical finishing. Awful.
Seems like we lost our rhythm.
Dangerous ball from Bruno almost costing us
"That‚Äôs terrible from Pogba you have to be finishing that off, story of our time under Ralf. The players have been woeful in front of goal"
Dude went past free like he was nth hahaha
Fred üî•üî•üî•üî•
Pogba held the ball too long inside the box
Trying to stay positive about all our missed chances so I'll just say Varane and Lindelof look great together.
Bruno what are you doing
Pogba doing his Rashford impression of refusing to pass the ball when surrounded by 4 opponents.
Again with the putrid decision making
great shot there bruno definitely the right decision
"I can only imagine Bruno gets as frustrated as we do when things don't work for him, at least it never stops him trying"
Pen!
That's a pen ffs
Fucking incredible.
What???????
We need one more attacking player on the field. Not enough support near the penalty box
No pen for me
WTF???????
What a fucking move....
That was fucking beautiful.
That‚Äôs two fucking penalties not given
And people wonder why players like Ronaldo dive
"Letter of law, should be a pen. But never going to be given by VAR as it was relatively soft"
Oh my days...what a goal that would've been a beauty
Oh wow
OH FOR FUCK SAKE PUT IT IN THE FUCKING NET
How the hell was that not a pen.
Matic has been class today. Hope his legs stay under him to see it through
Oh my god that was so hot
What a play. If only that found the back of the net
Today's not a day guys
Wow wtf we need to finish
HOW MANY MORE MISSES
HOWWWWW
"Fantastic play but Elanga joins Bruno, Ronnie & Pogba lol."
Has to score
Holy motherforking shirtballs how did we not score there that was beyond gorgeous
Christ I thought was in
what is our xG now? 15? :( plz
"Ahhhh Elanga had some great movement on that play, but he‚Äôs gotta bury that."
Great build up
OMG
Holy what a play!
Nice play there unlucky Elanga.
Wow
Elanga with improved finishing would be a proper baller.
FUCK ME
Fucking hell
Beautiful attack
What a goal that would've been!!!
Are we hexed? Just dreadful finishing‚Ä¶ every game
Another missed chance‚Ä¶..
Awb has been fantastic
How is that not a penalty? He clearly fouls Ronaldo and doesn‚Äôt get the ball.
Damn! we can‚Äôt score today
Now that one i think is
That was easy pen
Elanga and Matic have absolutely balled today
Elanga's finishing hasn't been good
Was his weak foot mid sprint but still should be on target :( Damn
"Would be criminal, if we don't win today"
Ronaldo and elanga chemistry üòÆ‚Äçüí®
I'm starting to like elanga but get sancho in now
"Love the technology.
Hate how the PGMOL use it.

Just scared to say their mates got it wrong."
At least we're not a chore to watch
"There's just no helping these players. No helping them whatsoever. We can see how much better they're being coached, they're up against a relegation side... still can't score a goal. What is there to be done at this point? What more do they need to do well?"
plz put the ball at the back of the net. my heart can't take this much longer
Brilliant block shame everyone shits on awb for any little misstep
Is the ref blind
THE GOAL IS LAVA
tbf Foster is an above average keeper on an average team
we need to get a goal soon
Blocked by our own player!
"Seriously, this is one of the insanest game I‚Äôve seen"
How in the fuck is this match 0-0
One of these days. One of these days.....
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs looking like it might not be United‚Äôs day‚Äù ffs when is it?
Actually taking the piss now.
You have to score the fucking tap ins!!!!
We could have a log of wood in the goal and we still wouldn‚Äôt score
"Damn, we really are cursed today..."
"Ralf subs OP, incoming Jadon banger"
"I‚Äôve always gone WTF with Ragnick pulling out a mid for a forward, but it‚Äôs worked more often than not."
It‚Äôs actually comical this
I'm of the school of thought that what we need to do is put the ball in the net.
I miss the oles at the wheel chant
So unlucky
We are cursed
How many misses/blocked shots is that for Ronaldo in this slump? It's genuinely painful to watch him miss chances every three days
I like that we are not spending 1 million years on throw-ins so that the fullback can cross continents to come take it.
Sancho please!
"Wow this is actually the change i wished to see. Matic as single Pivot, Sancho and Elanga wide on the Wings and Bruno/Pogba as double 8/10."
"Good sub, we can afford an extra attacker"
"United dominating the game and having some really good chances. 
We dropping points innit?"
Matic is a bit fading. We need to score now.
We are so bad at corners
Telles should be taking that corner
i dont like Matic without Fred
oh come on LOL
Cursed. 100%.
P A I N
I'm convinced we're cursed
Fucking hell we are cursed
This is quite funny
I havent the words....
Middlesbrough carbon copy so far
It‚Äôs almost funny
Lol I can't anymore how do we keep squandering every chance
"How‚Ä¶just, how?"
I wanna vomit
This is comical at this point
lmao pogba piggied him like a schoolboy
"Magnets, there must be magnets involved, I just, how!?"
"Are we human, or are we Brighton?"
Dennis taking an Uber PP
Lmao
He climbed on Pogba lmao
I'm gonna cry
Dennis trying to switch teams lmao
This is getting ridiculous.
How have we not scored.
I‚Äôm gonna need that picture of Pogba giving Dennis a piggyback ride
We're cursed
shadow of the colossus
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just not happening mate‚Äù
"This is ridiculous,"
Creating infinite chances atm üòÇ
Cursed FC
Maybe it's just one of those days.
This is getting ridiculousüòÖ
"We are winning it guys, relax!"
Telles is so one footed it hurts me
"Cavani being injured in this stretch has been such a blow for us, desperately need another option to Ronaldo"
Once again at the mercy of the subs
Ronaldo off rashy on
Even ricochet are not going our way in the Watford box
this isn't Cristiano's best match at all
Full out attack. Let‚Äôs go.
"Strap in bois, 4 at the front lol"
Rashford redeem yourself.
As annoying as this is I really appreciate how the players are trying to keep the ball in when it looks like they‚Äôre going to lose it
So a striker is a must in the summer
There's always 2 on Sancho. Where's the extra man? Not surprised Telles is coming off
Attack! Attack!
Going full yolo in attack now
Wait wtf
"Fuck it, we need 3 points here"
Pogba Bruno Pivot hahaha
I see the strategy is to play all attackers at once and hope for the best
Rashford for matic :) SAF STYLE
Love the subbing by Ralf. I was scared he'd sub off Elanga for Rashford. Great move.
Now would be an excellent time for Marcus to find his form
Matic has been great. Should have been Ronaldo off
Rashy brace inbound.
4-2-4?
Playing 4-1-5 lol
I‚Äôm surprised Ralf didn‚Äôt pull the hockey tactic and go for a empty goal lol
Ralf shows he wants to win. Havent had that at the club in a while.
I would not have taken Matic off
I get we need a goal but no DM?
Aaron??? Que???
Rashy winner here let‚Äôs go
"Come on!! Get it! Awb, please that was a great chance"
Anyone see the 'marking' on Rashford on that AWB chance? These defenders just grab and kick you at will üòÇ joke this game
Scoring ain‚Äôt on the menu today
DE GEA GET IN THE BOX
Blue balls
This is not good
"Just one, please."
Who put the curse around us?? Please someone tell me
Hiw this game is still 0-0 is unbelievable üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I just hope Bruno/Rashford dont take overcompensating shots for the last 10 minutes.
Fuuuuuuck meeeeeee.
Urg two crosses from Shaw are both utter shit so far
Gonna be loud as fuck if we ever actually score a goal
COME ON
We might as well just pass the ball back to the opposing keeper when we get an attacking set piece. That's about as dangerous as we'll get. Pathetic from Shaw that.
"The team es playing well. It has improved at least. But something is missing. For starters, crosses are far from being accurate..."
Cathcart looks like a small-headed Maguire
"Shaw so weak there, hold him off for the corner"
"The game is right there to be won, but no one wants to take it"
Shaw is a slug
We have 100% possession and can‚Äôt score?
Bruno please
Friends being a stickler for where a throw in is taken but not for Foster wasting 2 mins on each goal kick
"Sissoko is everywhere today.     
Reminds me of Rice when we played West Ham."
We‚Äôve created enough quality chances to be winning this match. We are just lacking some in our finishing. We‚Äôll have more chances before it‚Äôs over. Believe!
De gea has been so bored
Pogba is gassed
Duck that team is so shit and we can‚Äôt score
Rashford and Ronaldo looking at each other ffs
My eyes fuck meeee
Elanga looks like the only one who gives a fuck.
"Lol, Moussa said ""thanka for the press!"" Fucking nonsensical."
Rashford runs like a headless chicken and makes the wrong decision every single time
Next week is going to be an eye opening experience to say the least.
Welbeck?
I fucking hate Sissoko and how strong and fast he is
what is this shit seriously
Marcus Rashford trick y‚Äôall man. He just running around doing nothing.
Can't be arsed with the Europa League again. Hope we finish 9th.
We keep trying to walk it in Christ alive
We're actually going to drop points in this match unfucking believable
They are fucking gassed
"I had a ticket to this game, not watching it but seems like I made a good decision to not go"
we are so finished
He's knackered.
How on earth do half of our players look this knackered?
This is so frustrating
"Ronaldo ffs stop with the fake shot, I haven't seen that work once"
Does anyone have an old pair of shooting boots they could lend to our squad?
"Ronaldo, Bruno and Pogba are all shattered and off their game now"
We can‚Äôt play well and score in the same game.
Ole took our finishing with him it seems
We created like thousand chances and still can't score
Fuck sake Ronnie
Team is exhausted.
Uck foff.
Safe to say we're looking at the dawn of the decline of one of the/our best players ever?
All three strikers in the box made the exact same run
Wtf is this shit
Well this is a clear draw written all over again
Bro why in the fuck do we do headers when no one is close.  Just fucking control the ball
Shaw and rashford who have been on the pitch for around twenty minutes have shown how shit they are
Sancho has to use his left foot more
Low key this is embarrassing
Jogba not even showing for the ball now
Same players keep playing like shit week in week out. For some reason they are unstoppable.
So so so wasteful
Hero ball time it seems
Imagine if he‚Äôd scored that.
Sancho the only one creating but Pogba was alone at the top of the box there.
What can you really do if your attacking players can't score. Just one of those games. Utterly dominant but our profligacy has killed us.
Squeaky bum time boys
This kick has taken 45 seconds
Very poor all round
even 10mins added time wouldn't be enough
Everything is taking a split second too long
3 mins added time‚Ä¶. here we go
Has to be match fixing from the united forwards
They don't want top 4
This is fucking awful to watch
Sums Ronaldo up
"Ahhh, that one week in December when I thought we'd maybe sign Vlahovic is really causing me agony now."
Roy Hosgson is an annoying manager to play against but it‚Äôs our fault
We have been so wasteful.
FFS
good game
If they had score there....
CROSS THE BALL JESUS FUCKINN CHRIST
Wow
"Good performance, shit finishing"
Man. City opening a new one on United.
JOKE CLUB
"Ralf did his part, these players really blew it smh"
I just vomited
fuck sake
Fuck Hodgson. Fuck the ref. Arsenal will overtake us at this rate.
Sake.
Atleast from now onwards our opponents will be tougher and draw would be a good result considering this bunch /s
Is there any clip of the elanga penalty shout?
"Ronaldo now has 1 non-pen goal per every 414 minutes played under Rangnick. 

We‚Äôve tried blaming Maguire, Shaw, AWB, Rashford, Pogba, Bruno etc. 

But ultimately, we‚Äôre not scoring enough. And the man chiefly responsible for that is Ronaldo."
Took 10 seconds for a misplaced Fred pass
AWB put a cross better than dalot did whole season.
Ronaldo unlucky
"ffs Bruno, Ronaldo was open"
"Ronaldo needs a goal, seriously down"
Elanga MOTM so far
"We should be committing millions to age reversing research for Ronaldo, matic, and Mata"
rashford is finished man wtf happened to him
FUCK OFF BRUNO WITH THIS HEROBALL BULLSHIT
Someone has to say something about Ronaldo
"Elanga ,Bruno, Pogba should have scored. Ronaldo is really showing his age now, his legs are fucked, he should have scored too, plenty of chances for him. Rashford Sancho did nothing after coming on. No idea why Rashford has completely given up on football. No pass, no runs, no pressing nothing from him even after getting subbed on."
Cr7 lost it innit?
"Matic looks like the most confident player on the pitch. Pogba needs to be instructed differently, the guy is currently providing absolutely zero creative outlet, or pressure outlet or anything really. Elanga, his counter part for today looks far more dangerous than him."
"Horrible squad at finishing 

One of the worst crossing teams in Europe 

Can‚Äôt score from set pieces 

35 year old striker 

No real week to week CDM 

It‚Äôs so weird we can‚Äôt win matches?!?! So weird"
Like why shoot that Bruno? Lmfao
"Absolutely frustrating. Pogba, Ronaldo, Rashford, no impact."
"So far so good, it's looking actually good.

No Maguire to screw up Varane     
No Shaw to screw up defense     
Matic on CDM     
No Rashford to screw up attacks     
Bruno Captain

And of course, brilliant Elanga."
Ronaldo‚Äôs got less physicality than Lingard these days
"Lets sub Ronnie out asap in 2nd half, today is not his day."
Ronaldo is so poor. Shouldn‚Äôt be anywhere near our starting line up but we have no other option
"what a joke, 1+ million per week to the likes of pogba, cr7, rashford and awb just for them to be useless 90% of the time."
"Damn, i know this joke is overused at this point, but if we were the ones shooting Tupac, he'll truly be alive and well today."
Rashford  WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON WITH YA MATE
Bruno is not a big moments player what a wasteful shot with just seconds to go
"Not mad. We played well, just shit out of luck"
Ronaldo looks old
Ronnies gotta finish that one.
Not a pen imo
Ronaldo is so bad today
Trashford stinking up the place again
square it to ronaldo greedy bastard
Jesus Christ it's gonna be one of those games isn't it
"Don't want to see Shaw, Maguire and Rashy back tbh for now."
Ronaldo should've went down
FUCK OFF REFEREE
That‚Äôs a pen
"That's a penalty? Elanga gets his foot there first, fuck sake."
"I think we never dictate any teams as we did against Watford in the 1st half. Before the match started, i wanted us to trash, but now i will even take 1-0. Just need the 3pts. Pls dont drop anymore points, need the top4."
This seems an obvious penalty?
"rashford coming in, terrific time to play 11v10"
Ronaldo can barely walk
"USELESS, OVERPAID

RALF, FUCKING SELL THEM ALL IN THE SUMMER. FUCKING SICK OF THIS SHIT WEEK IN, WEEK OUT"
Remember when Rash made the comment that he hasn't been healthy the last few seasons and we gave him a deserved break to get healthy? I think injured Rash was actually better...
We need to get Ronaldo out at the end of the season. No way we can tolerate another season like this.
"Not a fan of either team, I'm a neutral watching the game. I don't know how Man U aren't up right now, Watford has been awful, absolutely dreadful passes, clearances, and overall decision making in the final third by them"
Bruno has had a pathetic game
Lads we are about to draw to fucking watford so that we can stroke ronnies ego for a fear of subbing him
Bye top 4 and bye ronaldo
Maybe Ronnie should be super sub because the legs don't look there since the injury he took earlier this year
"Three minutes added time when there were two VAR stoppages alone, blew up on the dot of that, and robbed us of a stonewall penalty and every single 50/50 decision down to killing our tempo being anal at every fucking throw-in. Can't bring myself to care when you're not getting a fair shake with the refs. Team largely played well, could've won the ball back with more urgency still, on another day we put a chance away. But what a fucking joke the refereeing in this league is"
Need a 10/10 performance from Bruno today. Prove he deserves the captain arm band over slab head
I hope Varane hasn't caught a severe case of the Maguire-ritis.
That shot may still be rising.
Ronaldo should've done better there to hold his run. Don't think Telles could've crossed any earlier
It literally should be 4-0. It's encouraging were creating so much but I hope it doesn't bite us in the arse that we've not finished off these chances.
"RR you are making an amazing job.
Covid, bad owners, broken players (mentally and literally) and in the middle of the season.
Hope we can win this cause we got 4 clearly chances so far"
That's 3 Bruno should have scored.
Bruno's finishing has been absolute garbage today holy crap
What a cross from ronnie. Bruno had time to chest that or just head it better ffs Bruno.
Bruno has been so fucking wasteful. Shocking.
Ronaldo making so many good runs no one‚Äôs giving the ball
We can‚Äôt score against a team sponsored by Doge Coin
And the shit reffing begins.
Maguire could never
thats never a pen lol
Looks like Elanga slipped. Actually think the ref got it right.
Pogba clearly the stand out player once again
"We keep missing chances, we‚Äôll get punished‚Ä¶ especially now they made it to halftime‚Ä¶"
Fuck these players man. You can see so much the improvement in coaching but our forwards refuse to capitalize. No doubt we somehow drop points against a fucking relegation side.
"Elangcho should be our wing pairing until the end of the season , no ifs or buts about it."
We‚Äôre honestly just so better without Rashford. I hope he spends a lengthy time out of XI to get his head straight.
Please no rashford. Sancho in please.
No one came to help Pogba
How is that not a penalty seriously?
"I know it‚Äôs only Watford, but we‚Äôve played fantastic today."
[deleted]
Need to score in the next 10 minutes.
Ronaldo's body language as bad as he is brilliant
this cycling gk lad aint too shabby
I can‚Äôt stand how much Ronaldo cries when he doesn‚Äôt get the ball.
Noooooo we can‚Äôt be going for a draw today
Sancho twisted Cathcart's blood
If only we had a world class striker to finish these chances being created.
what the fuck is up with bruno?
I hate to be that guy but I think it's ending 0-0 guys. Hope is dwindling
Why did we bring on Shaw
How has elanga been? Can‚Äôt watch the game
Is there a reason why we keep having defensive players take free kicks? First telles and now Shaw. Wtf is this shit?!
Rashford missed that wow
So is it just me or could Rashford have gotten to the ball in the middle of the box in the 82 minute?
How tf are we in the Champions league with this level of play???
Ronaldo lol. What is that Sunday league BS
I'd rather play with 10 men than Ronaldo at the moment.
"Get Cristiano off or something, there was no need to pass it to him at all"
Hooked Matic to lose control of the midfield so that we can watch Rashford being shit
Shaw has no urgency.
Shaw has no sense of urgency shoudl ahve kept telles
Something is clearly up with Rashford
Come on boys get a fucking goal
It just pain at this point.
"What a diabolical performance upfront. Bruno, Ronaldo and Pogba complete dogshit. Shocking. Rashford doing nothing again. Just woeful that we can‚Äôt convert one fucking chance."
Watford didn‚Äôt even play the game
I was about to say that was a good 45 seconds of meandering around being nonthreatening before I was realised it's been 93 minutes of that
Still want to know how we didn't get a fucking penalty.
Whats the point of players like ronaldo when they stop moving 70minutes into the game
who wants to get drunk
I can't believe I was watching this game and hoping for the ball not to land on Ronaldo's feet when he's in the box. It's almost a given now that he is going to mess it up.
"Man unfucking believable.. don't know what to do with this team. So many chances, like how do you NOT score. Watford were literally begging for us to score today. Would give away the ball, not just in their half but their own box.
 Ronaldo, for me personally, is done for a few games. Needs benched . Even in  UCL I didn't see him shimmer and shine. Just was his usual sulky self. His body language and attitude is so shocking. He stops making an effort if he sulking. We have the opportunity to seal a top four spot (can't believe I am saying this because that's not what we should be aiming for) but we sabotage ourselves. Anyways I am done ranting."
Maybe not getting top 4 is a good thing. All I know is I‚Äôm not watching Ronaldo drop 2/10s next year
Training for finishes doesn't translate on the field enough. Make it hard or harder than the real thing.
"That Dusan Vlahovic guy is so fucking good eh, dude seems like scoring goals for fun now. We need to look for someone like him."
Elanga is a better player than greenwood
"Cursed by ole, it‚Äôs his birthday and we‚Äôre playing watford. Might as well recall donny to score against them again"
Shaw is out for this season man. He really cant do any basics even fully fit
God Ronaldo has no pace
That's why de gea is third choice Spain gk fucking hell
"Ronaldo has ZERO business being offside 

This is a fucking comedy of errors and fuck ups 

Should be 3-0"
"Rhythm is a dancer

Putin is a chancer

Zelensky has balls of steel"
Play well for 15 minutes then run out of steam and play lazy. Truly impressive
Anyone else shout no as Fred goes to take a shot?
Pogba's positioning when we build up from the back is so poor. He doesn't show himself to receive the ball. He's more concerned about affecting the game in the final third so he doesn't get involved in the buildup to the final 3rd like a midfielder should.
Ronaldo is an old man
"Does it make anyone else so sad (and also frustrated) to see Ronaldo be unable to get anything right? And tbh he‚Äôs just lost his touch in my opinion, nothing else about it, too far past his prime"
"Elanga's doing all the things Rashford used to do when he first emerged. However, Rashford developed very little since then. He retained his best traits but failed to add any anything more. You could say the asshole we had playing until recently looked like he was heading down the same path

It's now upto the management to improve Elanga. He does a lot of good things but while they're good as a 19 year old, they'd be pretty average if that's all he can do at 24. Hope we manage this kid well"
Man.. get ronaldo off
How much does this team cost per week again?
People blaming Ronaldo when he‚Äôs been creating the most chances lmao
"The other day I criticised Ronaldo and was told it wasn‚Äôt his fault, because he wasn‚Äôt getting the service.
He‚Äôs getting the service today, so what‚Äôs the problem now?"
Shaw is finished. So is Maguire.
We don‚Äôt even have a striker to bring on for Ronaldo. Cancel Cavani‚Äôs contract because he clearly isn‚Äôt arsed
We‚Äôve been playing with ten men (with Ronaldo) since last few months. WTF.
Ronaldo was offside for at least two great chances and fumbled the shot for at least three. We need a striker in the summer
It's not a surprise that our finishing has gone to shit. Our best finisher turned out to be a sex offender and our second best finisher had to be loaned to Sevilla because he wasn't arsed enough to run on the pitch anymore.
pass to ronaldo tap in
"A pass to Ronaldo and that goal would've been something else. Now, it was just shit"
This is really poor from CR7 from his attitude to his effort
Is it just me or does Ronaldo always look like he has an attitude problem on the pitch?
The no televised 3PM game rule in this country is the dumbest fucking thing. Cannot stress my hatred for that stupid ass rule enough
[deleted]
No disrespect to Ronnie but dude is clearly in decline. We need to get a proper young striker in the summer
Bruno's having an absolute stinker
Bruno is getting on my nerves
If refs ever decide to be fair to Ronaldo. I will distribute sweets in my neighbourhood.
Look at Ronaldo.. the guy knows who's he's going to pass even before he recieves the ball.. compared to others who take eons on the ball
Wonder how long I'd last in my job if I was this shit at it.
"I get it, can't take Ronaldo off he has those late goals in him. But maybe this leaves us a bit bare in midfield, this is scary"
We hope to go atleast the semis of ucl and give ronaldo a proper send off
Shaw should‚Äôve stayed in Wembley stadium
If Rashford doesn't improve next season I want him out
Ronaldo should be dropped
Can I change my vote regarding Ronaldo in that athletic survey that was conducted here?
Ronaldo is finished... What a dusted player he is
Ronaldo embarrassing himself weekly
Ronaldo has been so shit recently :(
We're losing this aren't we?
[deleted]
Thats why Ralf cant stay permamently we need coach with balls to take players like Ronaldo off the pitch when they are shiting the bed
"Ronnie is old , he should have gone to easier league . He bit over estimated himself"
Ronaldo and Rashford with red arrows pointing downwards
Horrible from Ronaldo today
"Ronaldo was a T-Rex. Used to be
lethal, terrifying even. But they're both just fossils now"
This version of Ronaldo and all versions of Bruno aren‚Äôt good enough to be as reckless as they are in front of goal. If they aren‚Äôt converting then they‚Äôre a hard watch in the team
Ronaldo and missing sitters
"Please bench the useless cunt Ronaldo, who is obviously past it, he's scored 1 goal in 10 games, and he's been fucking dire, falling over, tripping over his own feet, terrible first touches and shots, who the fuck are you kidding?"
cristiano oldnaldo :(
This reeks of a 1-0 loss
Ronaldo isn‚Äôt finished. The doubters will eat your words soon
Ronnie needs to be playing less if he wants to prolong his career.
I‚Äôm so done with ronaldo. Praying he isn‚Äôt here next season and we can rebuild properly
"SOMEONE PLEASE TERMINATE RASHFORDS CONTRACT, I BEG."
Ronaldo :( He gotta score those
Ronaldo is the new Berbatov
Ronaldo not really helping us at the moment
Pass the damn ball fuck
"DAMN, HE SHOULD HAVE KILLED THAT ONE!"
How have we not scored yet?!!!
"We need someone like Aguero, someone who gets the scrappy goals. We don't need worldies, the amount of chances we create and nothing comes of it is insane."
"Ronaldo not timing that properly. So close to two goals in 15 minutes. Damn, I want him to score a hattrick or something to at least get some confidence"
Foster is one goal keeper that I don't celebrate our goals against. Absolute gem of a person and a good YouTuber!
The Solskjaer song :)
Bruno what the hell man?
Awesome chances. Should have been 3 nil by now. Bruno showing his class.
"Bruno two sitters mate, lol third time's the charm right?!"
Unbelievable finishing
I remember this. This is carbon copy of my fm22 where the opponent had 1 shot and won the game 0-1
How are we this unlucky man
Couldnt finish a chance if it was a coffee.
Bruno is so off form
Can solskjaer come back as our striker?
Bruno should have a hat trick at the point
Lol to all the people saying Ronaldo does zero build up play or offers anything else.
Ronaldo should have dived instead.
"Free header. 6 yards out. Misses the goal. Come on, Bruno. Against good teams, we can't afford to waste one chance never mind the four we've let slip so far."
This game has 1-1 written all over it by the looks of it so far
AWB is playing like a new man today. Love to see his progress
Telles is putting this top bins
Ronaldo go get the rebound
What we wouldn‚Äôt give for a 28 year old Matic. Levels above our other DMs
IT'S A PENALTY!! WTF Kevin Friend??!!
That do be lookin' penny
"Matic has been effective today. I just wonder if AWB can actually improve, or is this all he can be."
Don't think it's a pen
"How can the ref blow the whistle before 5 seconds?

There was time for one last chance."
I like Telles a lot.. feels like he is our best full back right now?
Bets on what minute we‚Äôre conceding? I say 49.
What‚Äôs pogba doing?
Ronnie‚Ä¶ either offside or not attacking high enough. Pogba should have just taken the shot!
Yet again.. Pogba just sits on the ball till he is dispossessed
It's like we forget what we're supposed to do in the opposition's goal area
The fuck was Pogba doing? Pass the damn ball dude
Seriously though we need to sub ronnie
It infuriates me that all our players saw Pogba was surrounded but no one tried to make themselves available. They were waiting for him to perform a miracle or something.
That's a pen come on
Fuck off.
People who wanted Graham Potter are getting what they wanted lol.
I love Elanga but then I remember how Rashford was when he came through. I hope Elanga doesn't lose himself the same way.
Ref playing against us
What the fuck is going on with this club
We're fucking cursed today
Ref really is shit.
I got downvoted when I said Fred would he subbed off for Sancho.  It is not because Fred did bad. But Bruno and Ronaldo won‚Äôt come off at 0-0.
"I know ronnie is a legend but honestly  if anyone was playing the way he has been playing, this sub would be going nuts. He doesnt run to the box when we need him, doesnt finish when we need him, walks off the ball"
I‚Äôm tired as fuck
"Lol, Dogecoin badge on Watford's sleeve."
Wan Bissaka looks good today.
Lads my bums getting a bit squeaky
He had no service at atleti granted but this is dire from cr7
Put rashford up front watford are tired he can make the runs in behind
We are not cursed. We are not clinical!
"How many times do I have to say..

WE ARE CURSED THIS SZN!!"
Manchester Unlucky FC
"Why‚Äôs he calling that watford player a loser, he‚Äôs decent üòÖ"
Take the old man off
Who the hell is Shaw coming on for wtf
We are going to be stung with these subs. Rashford's laziness will not sublimate the loss of a DM.
Pogba is hurt
Shaw bro. He should sit out some games. Awful yet again.
yeah no chance we're getting Top 4 given how shit we are at finishing chances and Arsenal still have a few games in hand lmao
This team makes me want to throw my monitor
jfc ronaldo
"That was pathetic from Ronaldo, he‚Äôs 37, shouldn‚Äôt be playing this much"
Ronaldo is as bad as Rashford
It wouldn't have mattered if City got him
The Board is just fucking us over and over so many ways
4 minutes left we need a goal and Shaw heads the ball out wtf
Thanks ronaldo‚Ä¶
Rashford useless
"Cristiano looks so off, can‚Äôt even recognize him, he‚Äôs always moaning man. I wonder what‚Äôs going on with him."
Definitely need a striker in the summer Ronaldo just ain‚Äôt it
Trashford
Stupid rashford
"That was a good chance and what he did, he fluffed, like many other chances. He is too old to lead the frontline. We should take him out of the club next season."
Martial needs to be recalled
This team deserves no respect
Have such dislike for Rashford now
FFS man. How do we miss all our shots
3 minutes added time
Welcome to Europa league
Welp there goes 90 mins I can‚Äôt get back
Ronaldo has me depressed
Dunno why Ralf keeps persisting with Trashford
Shameful. So fuxki g shameful
"Fucking hell, bunch of morons. Lacking brains, we need iq tests before we recruit players."
"With this sort of performance, Ronaldo should be happy with Europa conference even if he leaves united"
"The ironic thing is Ronaldo is going to fuck off to another club because we won't have Champions League football, despite the fact he's a major contributing factor to why we won't have Champions League football."
I dont want to see ronalfo ever fucking again.
End of en era performance here by ronaldo üòû
If Ronaldo can't score why is he even on the pitch?
Painfully mediocre from Ronaldo today
How do you not take Ronaldo off?
"This is the guy we ""have to convince"" to stay at the club lmfao"
Bruno you fucking IDIOT
Fred lol.
Back line already looks so much more fluid
Losing the psycho rapist was a blessing in disguise Elanga is at least 2 times better than him. Not in finishing but in the dynamic he ads to the team. I‚Äôm in love with Elangerino.
Bruno should have passed it to Ronaldo there.
For fucks sake Bruno???
Bruno is having a genuine shocker.
This looks like a match where we won't score even after 10 chances and Watford will with their only chance
Am I the only one who can‚Äôt stand the Country Roads chant?
is it mandatory for whoever wears the United armband to play like shit?
Looked like a penalty to me
Ref!! Pen?!
"He got the man first, come on"
How many times does Fred slip a match
This is highest paid squad in Premier League. And most boring
lmao this is more frustrating than we just play bad.
Just goes to show you don‚Äôt get the decision If you don‚Äôt surround the refs like pool and city do
"I've been telling you guys but you all don't believe me. 

Someone has put a curse on us this season to fail."
"At this point, maybe try rashy for ronnie"
"We should be creating chances every 5 minutes against Watford. Except we are struggling and creating half chances and expecting our lone forward to score.

I am more clueless now that we don‚Äôt have Scott playing who I have blamed a lot. And we have a solid solid squad playing now. What‚Äôs missing I don‚Äôt know."
"lol the FM 4-0-6.

If this somehow results in a loss delete this club üòÇ"
Why did we take Telles off for Shaw again?
Why are we playing Rashford when he's like this... He shouldn't be part of the squad.
Guys absolutely washed and has the club hostage
This is why you don't sign a geriatric Ronaldo to keep him from ruining his legacy
Rashford and Ronaldo both been piss poor.
Can‚Äôt wait for this sub to spend all week telling me how this was De Gea‚Äôs fault
Recall martial fuck sake
Liquidate the club
"Ronaldo is old and is basically a shell of himself, and his decline is something that we can understand to a degree considering his age, but Rashford‚Ä¶I have no words"
3 mins of injury time. Bye bye top 4
They defended really good.  We can‚Äôt score.  Fcuk this team.
Thanks to Ronaldo best efforts we managed to get away here with a draw
Someone surely did black magic on Ronaldo.
"Draw against Watford

Draw against Burnley

Barely beat Norwich

Loss against Middlesbrough

If this was Ole he would be getting torn to pieces."
"Ronaldo has literally one job in this team, finish chances. He can't do that. We need a striker desperately"
"DRAWCHESTER UNITED. can't even beat teams like Watford, Newcastle , Burnley. How TF can we beat PROPER Football teams. We are done. Derby , Liverpool and even Spurs are a threat right now."
we do need new striker please god
We DoNT cReAtE FoR RoNaLdO
Jogba
Should have let fucking City sign him
Pathetic scum. All of them fucking pathetic
Our 9 was completely static for much of the game. Messes up a shot and throws up his arms gg
[deleted]
Ronaldo is a shell of his former self.
[removed]
Well Ronaldo can leave now to go waste space on some other UCL team.
Wtf does Ronaldo always give up?
Ronaldo is frustrating atm
Wtf Ronaldo doing
Ronaldo needs to join Maguire on bench what a horrible game from him
SUB RASHFORD OFF
Bruno is a fucking useless cunt for taking that shot with so many in the box
Ronaldo been terrible
I don‚Äôt think Ronaldo has anyone to be angry about except himself
"I‚Äôll repeat and be downvoted to oblivion again

Ronaldo so shit lulz"
"Bruno had horrible game again, Ronaldo awful, Telles lost so many balls but yeah let's just blame rashford. Problem is we don't have any player who wants to take responsibility"
Ronaldo should nowhere near us
"ronaldo is finished, he is just and old grumpy man, his pace clearly declined a lot. Imagine if  it's 8years ago, he would run or just make a shot, now he's even losing his touch"
This is the game that we lose. Dominate the ball squander plenty of chances and give up a bad goal.
Bruno is awful when it actually matters
Pogba is a Rolls among Subarus
Ronaldo always looks like he‚Äôs is on ice skates
We need to bring in someone. Rashford maybe
"Fuckin hell rashford 
Overhyped as hell"
Can rashford just retire early and go and do his PR work? We‚Äôre forever stuck with him because he‚Äôs an academy player until he wants to leave which he won‚Äôt ask for
I‚Äôm glad we have the Goat all time highest scorer to score all of these goals for us.
Wan Bissaka is so poor‚Ä¶
"Ronaldo's finally coming back into some form. Finally scored last week, was one of our better players vs Atletico and is tormenting Watford today."
Ronaldo done. Go back to sporting or the MLS or hell even con Madrid into a contract. I do not care but you better not be playing upfront for us next season.
Fred 3 balls all lost. People downvoting a comment from someone who doesn‚Äôt want to see fred in the starting lineup.
"OH MY GOD BRUNO HOW ARE YOU NOT PASSING! RONALDO HAD A TAP IN SWEAT IT ACROSS GOAL YOU IDIOT

What a great chance wasted with a shit shot"
Pre Ronaldo Bruno would have passed
Ronaldo needs to chill with the arm waving - come on man everyone is frustrated we get it
Brunos fucking terrible
What exactly does Pogba add to games like these other than massively slowing things down to dribble around?
Jesus how many time pogba keep on falling
Seriously? Fuck off
Who do we have on bench to replace Ronaldo?
Should have subbed Ronaldo off for Sancho instead.
no defense just vibes
"We go to extra time right?
Right?
No?"
"Vintage Pogba

Absolutely stealing a living & has been for 4 years now

But can do a wOrLd cLaSs roulette turn coming off the bench for the last 30 minutes against tired  10 man Brighton at home you know

Good riddance when he goes, club will be so much better off for it"
Bruno has been absolutely abysmal. For most of the season.
"Any game we let Rashford and AWB play reduces our chances of winning ten fold. They‚Äôre subpar game after game.

Has happened for the past year and a half"
Bruno is awful. Awful. He's costing us big time
My god ronalfo is useless
"Ronnie is doing his best Lukaku impression. I know he‚Äôs pulled us out of deep, dark pits this season, but he‚Äôs been seriously off the boil today."
"Ronaldo fucking sucks. I wont get tired of saying it this season, he has been an awful signing"
"2:00 in Fred‚Äôs touched the ball 3 times. 
Given it away twice and conceded an unnecessary corner."
"Bruno didn't trust Elanga, forced the pass to Ronaldo"
Our finishingn is so poor ..I'd expect more from Ronaldo too
"I can‚Äôt put my finger on it, but we are so tidy in the back.  Hmm‚Ä¶."
Ronaldo should have went down.
Scenes when we lose by 0-1 with an own goal and no shot on target for Watford after all this missing of chances.
AWB isn't playing badly but I think we could do with Dalot's penetration here
Let Bruno take this please
United going into the half with no goals is so fucking embarrassing
FFS CLEAR PENALTY
Penalty?‚Ä¶.
Fuck VAR
Stonewall
"Ronaldo and Rashford must be working together on their runs, both can‚Äôt seem to stay onside."
Bruno can't handle being pressed. Always a shaky moment
I'd put Sancho in for Ronaldo or Bruno. We need someone uptop who can score
"Even with the chances missed in the last 15 minutes we haven‚Äôt been able to move the ball around swiftly into their final third.

That‚Äôs the issue I have been talking about. Bruno has missed one clear chance with Ronaldo missing a half chance. We can‚Äôt expect these people to be 100% clinical. We just have to create more."
It‚Äôs no coincidence that Ronaldo started off hot and then has been out of form recently. He‚Äôs 37 years old   Father Time is undefeated.  He needs a match or two to just sit
AWB is bang average. We need a better RB for sure.
"Ronaldo is so frustrating to watch man... fucking Mason Greenwood, we could have used the dumb cunt in this game."
Can someone tell me how the game's been so far? I'm out and I haven't been able to watch.
We‚Äôre gonna win guys. We‚Äôll get the 3 points but it will won‚Äôt matter. We will finish 5th. Pessimistically optimistic.
Don‚Äôt pass to ronaldo..on my mother he‚Äôs playing against us
"Elanga picking up the Rashford/Martial/Greenwood trait of dribbling directly into defenders instead of laying it off. 

What kind of attacking coaching do we do?"
Can someone explain to me why we keep playing Ronaldo?
"Ronaldo is depressed seeing this team.

Just like the rest of us."
I just don‚Äôt like these players.
We really should not have let Martial go on loan
CAN WE FUCKING SHOT!
AWB is lethargic and unsurprising. Just a pitiful player
"Don‚Äôt be a bitch Ronnie, he had every right to take that shot"

"Ronaldo's attitude could be so demoralizing sometimes. He whines and moans and points fingers at his own teammates. Mistakes happen, just get on with the game, especially when you're chasing the game."
"That was so fucking close, excellent cross from Elanga
Edit: my bad, excellent cross by AWB"
WTF has happened to Ronnie?!?
Missing McTom
Ronaldo just doesn't have the legs for it anymore
Wan Bissaka might as well just lay it off to a Watford player directly whenever he gets it.
That‚Äôs for sure a pen
Thats a pen
Man Ronaldo can‚Äôt take any man on these days
Bruno having an awful game. Ronaldo average. The rest of them have been fine. Attackers letting us down.
Ronaldo should be subbed
Idc Ronaldo is finished
I feel bad saying this but I honestly hope we we don‚Äôt make top 4 so that Ronaldo leaves and we get a younger vibrant striker whose place in the XI isn‚Äôt in doubt because of an older famous player.
Ronaldo can‚Äôt start every fucking game as a striker. Huge mistake to send Martial on loan especially with Greenwood out.
Greenwood really fucked us over
Yeah I'm cool with the Ronaldo experience being over
Look at Pogba just standing there in the middle.
"Not sure how many of you are still fooled but this is a very unserious team. They can put out all the PR they want that they are fighting and in it together but then they go out and do that. If you don‚Äôt think that was a must win and win it big then not sure what to tell you. Arsenal are right on their heals with a better goal difference. All followers and no leaders. Now I‚Äôm going to go enjoy the rest of my Saturday, see you all next Sunday to do this all again!"
Ronaldo is tragic
Fred has started
Pogba needs to speed it up
What a shit ball from Pogba
Rhythm he‚Äôs a dancer
"Ben Foster is going to have one of those game again, isn‚Äôt he."
Foster turning into prime Yashin
Typical Ronaldo
that was a goal if bruno passed to ronaldo
"This is how it usually goes‚Ä¶we constantly give the ball away with poor passing, then the few times we actually have great buildup play we can‚Äôt finish it. So often we rely on moments of individual brilliance, the team play and quality build up is so inconsistently displayed."
Elanga is the best player in the world don‚Äôt fucking @ me
Very sweet football that üòî
GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLL......oh no
Watch our back 4 w/o Maguire‚Ä¶.see how fast they get back then transition into attack‚Ä¶
Pathetic finishing is costing us
Hopefully we won‚Äôt concede late just like the 4-1 match months back :/
It‚Äôs not happening people
Just go down man wth
Bring on Sancho for Bruno at half time
How many chances has Bruno missed!
[deleted]
Get Dalot in for Wan Bissaka at HT
"We're playing really well, but my god if we don't start putting away these chances we're going to rue it if Watford get the first goal. Ronaldo is not at the office today"
Foster is such a solid keeper
"alright Rag, i understand we needed heavy work on tactics in training and it takes time to do that.... but perhaps we should start giving a little time to practice finishing as well"
Our wastefulness is an art in itself.
Please let bruno take it
Watch Ronaldo sky this
PEN
Flip sake robbed man
"Defender went through the man for the ball, I think?"
Number of times united players make a mess of a simple pass and then apologize is insane
Ronaldo definitely needs a good run of games. I can see how bad he wants it.
Don‚Äôt even want to know the xg of that half.
Does ronaldo really need to drift out left? He has been pretty wasteful every time he has done that
Didn't watch the first half Properly heard bruno was selfish and we should have been at least 1 up?
It‚Äôs all fun and games until someone captains Bruno on their Fantasy Premier League team üòÖ
"If we can't score quick goals after half time, I dont see wining this one"
How do we always start second halves so poorly
I like how people talk about Ronaldos performances now like he's playing like Kane or Benzema when they don't score.
I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôs offside.
Perpetually offside
Pogba wtf mate
What was Pogba thinking
Pogba why you not shooting? Bloody hell.
It would be really cool if we were good
Why do footballers spit so frequently?
My heart dropped
FFS PENALTY?
 Lmfao that‚Äôs a pen
I‚Äôm starting to get bad vibes from this
Are you fucking kidding me
"Wtf, thats a penalty"
Perfect pen
More shit finishing
"I don't care if we knick it 1-0 after playing like this.

We should play more like this.

Finally we are showing that we can play like City/Pool."
Just score dammit üò≠
üé∂ We‚Äôre Man Utd and we‚Äôre never gonna score üé∂
"I‚Äôd be getting Pogba off honestly, has been ok, nothing great. Bring Lingard on, he can be good for a goal against this lot."
Paul Piggyba lol
The delivery from Bruno ü§å
"Watford aren‚Äôt even playing soccer at this point, mf defense simulator"
Yes shaw üòç
"Regardless of the score, Sancho is a baller. Unbelievable skills!"
Queue Rash doing something stupid to fuck up a sitter‚Ä¶
Caption game: what did Rashy say to PP?
Bruno
This is looking bleak
I missed the second hand so far. How have we been playing? The same as the first half or worse?
Getting Van Gaal vibes today
Bruno is starting to do too much
what happened to luke shaw?
"Top four is going to be difficult as it is, drawing this came might put it out of reach"
watching Pogba doing defensive is so painful...
Wtf Pogba
Come on Regista Pogba
"Why pass Ronaldo who can't do shit anymore... fucksake man JUST SHOOT! Stop this fucking shit, you failed them constantly."
Man Ronaldo is tired af
Can De Gea fking come out an act as a sweeper?
All these old heads don‚Äôt have the legs for 90 mins man lol
CR7 having a stinker
I will be fucking livid if someone still backing up Ronnie after his performance today.
Ronaldo wtff
Fucking sign haaland now
How can an international player be as shit as Rashford
It is in the history of the Manchester. We got this
Rashy should be dictating the tempo since he is fresh. But he is turning  martial to want ball on his feet
"No cl next year, deservedly"
"Our lack of aerial presence really hurts us in these situations. Crossing has to be so accurate to find Ronaldo, our only header of the ball who is very slow, while others are no threat at all with poor movement for targeting."
Have Rashy got a touch yet?
"Don't need Europa or Conference league nonsense, rather finish outside that spot"
2 shots on target. That's it
Ronaldo is not suitable for this team. Ralf is sacred to sub him off.
Is that Gernacho kid a striker? Could be a shout though maybe a bit early
"Abramovich - ""I'll be in control from the Shadows."""
United begin down the path of their mighty battle for a place in the conference league
Ronaldo is trash. Don't care if he scores later.
I'd say Ronaldo cost us the games with how poor he is upfront
Ronaldo has to go in the summer. Throws off the balance of the team and just isn‚Äôt good enough to lead the line
FFS Trashford...üò°
Rashy? sub him off.
Not sure why we didn't even get one of the penalties. Hope Watford gets relagated.
"CR7 not playing nearly well enough to sulk, hang his head, and complain like he is. It‚Äôs frustrating to watch"
I'm gonna get downvoted but I think it's obvious that Shaw is head and shoulders above telles
Fuck sakes I‚Äôm sorry but De Gea is not good enough
Fred really carrying that piano alright üò©üò©
Bruno needs a rest man
Ronaldo pff
Fred‚Äôs hands up to apologise for failing to make a simple pass gives me PTSD
Fred or Matic for Sancho and we win this game
Bruno again with another shit cross -_-
A draw it is then... just one of those days. again
We suck so bad. Jesus Christ
rashford and ronaldo ened to eat bench for a while. idgaf if one is an academy lad and the other a living legend. they currently fucking suck and its impossible to win 9v11
Watford is so shit that even De Gea wasn‚Äôt forced to make his usual mistakes.
"So, I'm not watching the game, but I get that Ronaldo ain't playing well? Again.
(btw thanks for the earlier comments lads)"
Dickhead bruno
"Ronaldos movement has been class, shame no one looks up when he‚Äôs made a free run."
The silver lining if United end up in the EL is that it will mean Ronaldo will finally leave
Ronaldo doesn't finish chances anymore ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Yeah we gon lose
Take Bruno OUT.
Lol at this point get ronaldo off
Think it's more than time for Ronaldo to go.
Nah im fucking done with him..he‚Äôs actually finished
"\s

Awb cannot cross."
[deleted]
Ron has been shocking
AWB is so bad it hurts. How did we pay ¬£50m for him?
"Ronaldo is fucking awful, legs simply don't work anymore"
What the fuck was that? Elanga doesn‚Äôt want Ronnie to score! Haha
I know we look better but the main thing I struggle with is we don‚Äôt seem to create one clear chance. I still believe Cristiano will get his goal today but we always struggle to create one clear chance.
Not battering this Watford in itself should be a sackable offense let alone drawing to them ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Pogba and Rashford are just wastes of space right now
Fuck off Ronaldo you fucking attacking black hole
"I‚Äôm completely done with ronaldo, he is way off the pace and I think he‚Äôs finished at this level"
Fred is actually shit and if you think he‚Äôs good enough to start here you‚Äôre part of the problem in this sub
"I don't think constantly getting the ball to Ronaldo isn't  going to work for him , it worked with Zlatan because Zlatan was a much more complete striker"
[deleted]
"F\*CKING JOKE üòÇ

Zero ownership

Zero manager

Zero players

Zero team

Any other semi-decent team would have beaten this hornets, but this United can't do shit at their own home. Nobody respects United anymore, even the lowest shit from the 4rd division in the league cup comes to OT and gets something."
Ronaldo is so shit lulz
Ronaldo only bench option from now on please guy is finished
Bruno has missed 3 open goals now
Ronaldo been utter garbage
Cristiano is cursed dude
Man eff this. Removing midfielders to accomodate for the lack of goals is honestly whats going to cost us this game. Watford will make it a midfield battle and pogba is not good defensively
Weak mentality.. every single one of them. Won't be surprised if Watford did the double over us
Ronnie mate it's time to retire
Ronaldo is pure comedy. I want to hear what cr7 apologist come up with now.
[removed]
Time for ronaldo to go to the MLS
Ronaldo is finished
Is Cavani not fit to start? Kind of tired to see Ronaldo‚Äôs nonchalance.
"I have been his biggest fan for decades, but CR7s whining putting great pressure on his teammates to make bad passes to him."
I‚Äôve stopped expecting much of anything from Bruno. I don‚Äôt recognize him from last season
Elanga is üî•üî•üî•
Can someone wipe out the impostor in Bruno‚Äôs place?
Too soon to sub Bruno?
That‚Äôs a dumb decision by Fred
Can mctominay and matic swap age? Does anyone knows magic?
portsmouth range and angle
"Not a pen, defender got the ball clean. Quit with the bias."
"Sub in Sancho for Ronnie, and swap his position with Bruno, let Pogba & Bruno play as AMs and play hold up plays for our wingers to run in. Sancho will be better choice with all the short passes and 1-2s we are playing."
"I‚Äôm more embarassed that we let in two goals to Leeds, spurs beat them 4-0 ffs"
"Ronaldo and Bruno having a fucking stinker so it doesn't matter how well coached we are, our shitty forwards refuse to fucking score."
Elanga is better than Messi
Only 2 shots on goal?
How Fred and not Bruno is beyond me
No way Matic should be coming off. Ronaldo should have been hooked
"Dunno why u would take Matic off ,  Ralf is  just sacrificing balance for attackers."
The irony of us being sponsored by team viewer when we play as a group of individuals is not lost on me.
RONALDO IS TRASH
Lmao what has happened to Ronaldo
Ronaldo&bruno single handedly lost us the game
Imagine celebrating a draw like that
Only United will play a home game against a team second from bottom with two DMs. SMH.
"We have had one good chance whole game the rest being half chances and headers. 

The score is not surprising. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs Bruno or Elanga or Ronaldo missing the bunch."
Pogba off and sancho on for me. I'd be tempted to try rashy up front instead of Ronnie as well
Ronaldo is starting to piss me off.
"Today's worst performer was Bruno Fernandes by a mile. Horrible decision making. Spurned two great chances. Should have put the team first and passed it for an open goal of his first chance. His delivery is horrible. None of his crosses ever beats the first man, ever! Not corners, not even when he does it from deep. Elanga and Ronaldo combined well to set up Fernandes twice and he fucked it up. 

People compare him with KDB but I wish he had half his talent for that final pass."
Letting Martial go (even though his form was shit) when Rashford and Ronaldo have hit shit form just looks silly now.
Martial was never as bad as Ronaldo and Rashford have been this season
"When is Ralf going to get it through his thick German skull Maguire is a liability. We always look better with Lindelof/Varane, and play a higher line. Stop bringing Maguire back in."
"Bruno is the most to toxic player he keeps yelling at players, while he makes mistake occasionally."
I wish Ronaldo didn‚Äôt come back to decline. His time here would have been forever romanticised if we only remembered his first stint.
"Fernandes is a terrible footballer and no amount of stat padding can convince me otherwise. Also, why didn‚Äôt he square it to ronaldo in the first half?"
Bruno plays against us more than for us
Terrible half. A half where you get so many chances but score nothing is what encourages opponents n drain your energy. Get back on it Ronaldo n Bruno seriously fucking poor.
Ronaldo hold the offside rule in as much contempt as he holds the concept of consent
Need to buy James Tavernier from Rangers in the summer.
Fred
Bruno you need to pass that
"Great to see that useless lump Maguire Benched at last

Long may it continue

Let's go boys, make sure he doesn't ever get back in the team"
Why wouldn‚Äôt you start Sancho?  And is McTom injured?  Not even on the sub list.
"Fuck's sake man, just fucking shocking how bad our forwards are at scoring."
What a fucking joke lol.
We need Sancho so Fred can be sacrificed.
Roffaldo
Take Ron off and set an example
We're actually going to draw. THis club is cursed
Trash team. Pure trash
why did sancho pass it so early. not ronaldos fault
We should have sold Ronaldo in the last transfer window.
Would you consider giving Ralf the permanent position if he was a good manager?
"GG we're not winning this, 100% a draw again"
Let‚Äôs gooo
Good luck everyone!
Let's go boys
"This Watford side are shit and will be relegated, we really need to batter them today."
Let‚Äôs go!
"hate playing Josh King, he's got a real knack of scoring against us"
"Ah fck Joshua King, he always score against us since after he got linked with us during Ole days."
Happy Saturday lads. let‚Äôs have some fun today.
Beautiful start from Fred
We go reds
"Give us a quick and easy win and a nice weekend lads.

Also a must win with Arsenal of all teams probably favourite right now for top 4...."
Pogstriker!
Fred
"We should be beating Watford comfortably, other teams in the league have beaten them comfortably. Also, after the last match under Ole, I so want some revenge for that 4-1."
Every game is a cup final for us better see some intensity today
So scrappy to start.
Let's hope United will win by a big margin to improve the GD as well. It might be crucial in the end on snatching top 4
"Fuck man, Ronny - gotta finish them"
So fucking unlucky man
How are we doing guys. Cant watch rn
Pogba not looking comfortable on the right
Wtf Pogba?
Elanga is the man! My man can cross better than most of the our players.
Anyone know which international channels are broadcasting this match?
We start to put them under pressure and immediately slow down. We can play with fear and reservation.
"Honestly, De Gea will never get better at passing. Do we just stop trying to play that way?"
Was that ball going in if ronaldo didnt stand there? it looked like it. Why would ronaldo just stand still in that position when someone is about to shoot ffs
We look so balanced when we have a DM on the field. Can‚Äôt wait for us to sign someone in the Summer.
Great block by Ronaldo
Bruno and Ronaldo both know that was going in
Bro what is this formation man loool
I hope Varane hasn't caught a severe case of the Maguire-ritis.
What the hell has happened to Bruno‚Äôs finishing?
"I don‚Äôt understand why all these players hold the ball and stand, practically begging the other team to surround them"
Wtf Bruno
Players getting that confidence and swagger back
The defence has to clear long and to the sides and not straight to the opposition in the center of the box.
That was beautiful until the end
Hope that Bruno miss doesn't bite us in the ass later.
"Watford are really bad, not putting up much of a fight, if we drop point here, I don‚Äôt know what to think"
We still haven't learned how to finish. Have to take these chances in games like this
Should be 2-0!
Lovely play by elanga there
Great block by Foster there to be fair
I swear this team is self sabotaging. It should be 3-0
"Should be 1-0 already, we have to be way more lethal"
Every game I feel like this is the day we'll finally score all those chances and then every game these people take the same shit shots
"Bruno's shot hit Ronaldo, and Ronaldo told him he moved for him?"
Stfu we played 13 minutes we will win big
How could you not score from there? Oh Bruno Bruno Bruno
Comeon Cycling GK
Ralf needs to get everyone on finishing drills
How we playing boys
How do we like Bruno on the left.
None of them deserve to be on the same pitch as Elanga /s /not s /s
Our finishing is shocking.
What happened to Bruno's finishing
We just forgot our shooting boots ain't we?
Offside
Elanga is so smooth
Af fuck
fuck just a tiny tiny bit offside
Just a split second earlier. Good play
In form Ronny 2 goals rn
Very close
"Jesus, Elanga is so good"
Elanga and Telles so sick
"NOOOOOOOOO, OFFSIDE"
Knew it was too good to be true sigh
If we dont win this fucking game
Unlucky
starting to believe in curses
Elanga is so good
Elanga is a fast one isn‚Äôt he. Loving it
Matic playing like it‚Äôs 2017 against West Ham
Elanga and Fred with standout performances so far. Bruno pretty decent too
FUUUUCK HOW WAS HE OFFSIDE
Elanga playing with confidence and brains. Something we've been missing
Imagine going into the fixtures we got coming up being 3-0 up right now
SIOOOOOOO
"We are getting closer, come on boys"
It‚Äôs looking like practice for us right now! Gotta fucking finish ffs
It‚Äôs about taking chances  also
How??
A lot of silk going on today.
Nooo
So unluckyüò≠üò≠üò≠
"We are cursed, once again we CANNOTT finish .. and we might get punished"
Wtf Bruno.
What is this finishing
"Playing great. Now keep at it, be fucking patient lads!"
Fernandes!
Ah that was unlucky goes down to how the ball hits your leg
Hahahaha
Come on Bruno wtf wrong with you
5-0
Bruno in poor form
What has happened to Bruno man?! üòû
Jesus Christ Telles
We should be 4-0 by now.... Definitely gonna draw the game
Yeeesh
How in the fuck haven‚Äôt we scored
This is going to be one of those games that should be a blow out and we‚Äôll fuck up and tie.
Reminds me of that first Mou season where we kept creating so many chances but never scored any. Kind of frustrating but at least we're playing well attacking-wise.
"Bruh Bruno, another missed chance‚Ä¶."
PLEASE SCORE FFS
How many more
We re missing big chances but I like a lot what I am seeing for now. Let's keep going like that
Good ref
This high line might be costly üëÄ
TAKING THE FUCKING PISS
I actually think they are missing on purpose right now... Like wtf
Any thoughts on why AWB is playing over Dalot?
Elanga with a good action
Bruno is playing against us ü§£ü§£
Bruno‚Äôs bottled like 4 chances already
Should have gone down Ronny.
FOR FUCK'S SAKE BRUNO.
At least we are lively.
Only reason we're not winning is because we don't control defensive transitions well enough. Gives teams a release valve from the pressure you're putting on them defensively if they're able to move through the thirds on the break regularly enough. In every other phase we're playing really well
Can someone make a compilation of all the misses?
He‚Äôs our magnifico (just not today)
Elanga is our best player
"Working not watching today, can any tell me how we look through the first 1/3 of the game?"
Playing really well. Finishing‚Äôs just not there yet.
What's Bruno's xG this half üòÖ
Corner
Bruno missing sitters! Should've burried the second one.
Matic is still so much better than mctominay
Cmon Ronny
"Watford is shit, but we are creating chances, which is great!!"
How how we havenot scored a single goal yet
Hopefully this missing clear chance won't cost us the game
It feels like nothing will go in today.
Surely a JuJu! Impossible to be this unlucky
jesus 30min had gone by....
Pogba playing handball lol
We need to put a few of these away
Man I dunno how we are not in the lead
Ronaldo into the wall
Let Bruno or Pogba take it
Please let Bruno or telles take this Ronaldo
I feel like we are watching Groundhog Day. Creating like crazy with nothing to show for it.
Watford is shit.
Score this free kick
Bruno range !
"Couldn't watch, how is United playing with Pogba on the wing? Or what's the actual formation?"
We are due someone a proper skelping honestly. Come on boys get a goal
We are a little too casual out of the back sometimes
I love how Sissoko always looks like a kid who hasn‚Äôt quite gotten used to his body yet.
Var var var
"Booing rhythm, really, get them boy‚Ä¶"
We are fucking cursed.
I dread the second half
Matic wtf lol
"Not watching

How are we doing?"
"Only 1 minute added time? 

That is some fucking nonsense."
Good half. Everything but the goal
"How the fuck is it 0-0!! We‚Äôve had so many great chances. Should put them away second half, Elanga and Sancho to score."
We have looked good and created chances. A good sign at least even if the finishing is miserable.
"Lingard x Pogba and maybe later Jason x Elanga, Bruno is still blocked to make goals"
"Good game so far, we just have to maintain it in the second half and a goal should come."
Really sucks when I can‚Äôt even enjoy a game like this because I‚Äôm worried about us not getting our goal
What's the song that was playing in the stadium?
lets score this time. please
"20 seconds to get a corner, geez"
Let's get the 3 points.
Looks like it‚Äôs Pogba out to the left and Bruno as the 10 now.
I'm tired Robbie
He was passing I think
"Well, that was clearly a Watford goal kick... evening out I suppose!"
matic man of the match?
Seen this kinda game too many times from us ffs
We have got subs today.
And following the script of being poor in the second half
An advanced Telles on the same flank as Pogba makes me nervous everytime they lose the ball
"Sancho, rashford in for elanga and bruno?"
Matic is distributing and recovering well. So this is what united with a DM look like?
Bring on Sanchooo
"The only time Cristiano should have fallen down, he keep running"
I criticized Bruno for losing the ball in his own end a minute ago. That means he'll probably pop up and score.
Penalty‚Äôs
That‚Äôs a pen lmao
So surely we get this one?
Just give the penalty because I can‚Äôt trust this team to score lol.
Ofc
Wow
What crisp passing but still no goal
Noooooooo
What a great combination. Elanga is amazing
Build Up United
Another miss hahaha. This team man.
Cmon‚Äô Lads
"Sublime bulid-up. 

Need to finish these chances. 

Guess it‚Äôs not anyones day"
"what the actual fuck

amazing build up and of course it goes fucking wide"
Omg.
That was smooth asf only the finish was off
We‚Äôre cursed.
That was beautiful
"that's not a pen, wtf"
"Ronaldo can‚Äôt buy a call. Stays on his feet to avoid a pen. Goes down, it‚Äôs not enough."
Fucking stupid ref
I love elanga
Has to be a pen
Oh my god
Oh my tucking god
"First one with Elanga I can understand, how tf is this one not a penalty"
How?
Just cannot finish lol.
Ahh ball just a little out in front of Elanga there
"What's happening to us today, please guys please score"
amazing buildup.  just gotta work on that finishing kiddo!
"Went down soft but defender was clumsy, should be a pen"
"Haha, fuck this shit, VAR has been fucking us for way too long now."
Jesus that was beautiful. It's a shame we can't find the net today
We have a new Tony in town no doubt - Rapid Tony
"Could've been pen.. Elanga, stared that, could've finished it slightly more to the inside. Great play"
such gorgeous football! üòç
That was beautiful by Elanga
Matic running the show
"The fact we have to HOPE for a penalty being awarded by VAR is just plain pathetic. SO MANY chances from open play, yet we can‚Äôt finish, so we‚Äôre reduced to HOPING for marginal penalty calls to go our way. Just finish HALF of the chances we create and we‚Äôd be running away with the win and not giving two shits about penalty calls either way."
How did Elanga miss that
I'm speechless. How have we not scored.
We're playing good football but there's not enough men in the box
They‚Äòre just taking the piss now
AWB done well
We've made a dogs dinner out of this.
Fuck.
FFS
Bruh
HOOOOOOOOOW
how are they not scoring
Why are we so unlucky
Thats some shit luck
oh wow
Are you kidding me?
Fuck me
Oh my god what is this
How..just..how
Reminds me of the famous van persie and Rooney slumps... just nothing working for him
Cursed cursed cursed
Nonsense
What is this game man
how many chances have not scored from today
Just not our day
xGFC
Solid from Fred.
Finally Sancho. We desperately need more creativity down the left. Nobody making runs
I miss Brunos little flick ons
A performance where your finishing is utter garbage can't be described as fantastic.
This is such a fucking stupid game to watch - there has to be proper finish with how well some of the passes have been. Fucking hell
Rangnick showing 8 with the thumb reminds me of the scene from Inglorious Basterds about Germans  and their counting.
Please Sancho change this shit
2-0 united. Calling it now
"Time for corner goal?

Edit: lol."
Really good from AWB. Need more from Ronaldo
"Damn that was a dangerous ball, thankfully OT has a predictable ground. Sunday league that would be in lol."
Telles the human turnstile
"With Watford finally starting to break, Matic is going to be a liability."
Our corners probably result in attacking opportunities for the opponents more often than to us
I'm just annoyed now
"Pogba is tired, he should‚Äôve stayed on the left, he was playing well there."
We are cursed‚Ä¶.
Beautiful ball from Bruno \*_\*
How the hell man
Come on
Kind of tough to break down a back 11
We need someone ice cold
What do we have to do to get a goal
I‚Äôm gonna lose it
What the absolute fuck
We can‚Äôt even get it in my hand.
How's that not a yellow?
We are definitely cursed it is the only logical explanation
It's like the ball just doesn't want to go in for us.
This legit seems like a curse
How can he not finish that
Excuse me
Have Watford even been given a single card today?
HOWW
Pogba taking Dennis on a piggy back ride
Gotta at least win a corner there. Great ball by Sancho.
Watford already wasting time
"This is like a training match and it's 0-0. Seems like match fixing üòÇ

Or these lads are legitimately crumbling under the pressure of Arsenal playing well. I shudder to think they're this weak...."
Shaw and Rashford?
Neither of these players are the answer but I hope they prove me wrong
Watford playing with 7 defenders
"should've fucking capitalised earlier, Watford will park the bus now that the game is nearly over"
Too much edging
so painful
We are cursed!
Bruno - Pogba cm
Who will defend
"Fuck a midfield, who needs it...."
"Playing great‚Ä¶ I mean.. we shouldve had 5 goals. But I mean definitely playing some of our best, at least when creating chances.

Wish Cavani wasnt out"
We're playing so well. I'm sure we're getting the goal soon.
Matic MOTM
"Rashford telling Pogba, you‚Äôre the 1 in the 415.  Congrats."
One CM left and it's Pogba lol
Uhm... So no midfield then?
Pogba and Bruno as the two deep midfielders.
another rangnick masterclass incoming
MOTM matic !
Love this from Ralf
 Arsenal are a problem this season.
We figure out one thing and then forget something else. What is this team?
Matic? Lol we're gonna concede now aren't we?
Matic off????
Just Pogba in midfield now?
Damn we are all in for attacking
That player has no fade wtf
"Rashford right through the middle right now please, he will score"
Best header of the game so far
Nice run awb
All out attack
BELIEVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
How the fuck have we not scored
I‚Äôm confused w the formation someone enlighten pls haha
With the run of games coming up we really have to win this game
I think we‚Äôre playing too well Clive.
March is going to be a rough month
How is this real
Watford happily parked the bus
Left side looks so much worse now
This is ridiculous how they can't score
Pogba gassed
I don‚Äôt want this game to need any heroics‚Ä¶
Matic should not have gone off
Bruno you idiot you had options there
This Kuco guy is absolute dogshit
Pogba looks exhausted.
Why did marcus dummy that‚Ä¶
Pogba alright? Hes quicker than that.
Nice from Sancho but Pogba couldn‚Äôt arrive on time. That should have been a goal.
Bruno genuine ass this game Christ
BRO PLEASE. THE GOAL. WE JUST GOTTA GET ONE
Feel like we have zero off-ball movement
Individual players trying to put it all on their back again and dribble through the entire Watford team‚Ä¶
pogba hello????
This game has made me pukish with the amount of missed chances
AWB goat
Yo is Elanga actually right or left footed? He dribbles so well with both feet
Bad from AWB there.  Lindelof defending 2 players.
I've lost hope.
It's lucky Rashford changed his hair or I wouldn't even know he was on the pitch
Bruh
Overthinking it
SOMEONE PLEASE SHOOT THE BALL
Ronaldo dispossessed again when trying to dribble people
Fuck rashford sucks
"Players are knackered, no off the ball runs"
Fuck we can‚Äôt finish almost like we‚Äôre trying to hard
"Why do so many players look this extremely gassed. Pogba and Ronaldo can't even walk straight anymore, running is out of the question"
This team seems to have zero chemistry. Extremely frustrating to watch
Who did Sancho check back?
We posses well and then get into the final third and somebody‚Äôs touch always ruins the attack lol
Sissoko has been everywhere
Why wouldn‚Äôt Sancho cross it there?
We're crossing as if we have a fellaini or a Kane to hold it
The number of points dropped against relegation battlers is ridiculous
Need a fergie time goal
SO NEARLY
Oof sancho
I would've woken up the dead had that gone in
Ralf looks pissed.
Rather finish 15th than get Europa next season ffs
Ronaldo doesn‚Äôt have any stamina anymore. Should have been subbed earlier.
We've probably created more chances in this game than the last 3 matches combined
Both teams so tired.  Really was a game to bring Lingard on
"May 22nd can‚Äôt come quick enough, this season has been fuckin depressing man"
Pain
Watford deeper than the fisting I took last night
I'm sick and tired of everything.
I don‚Äôt know who or what will be able to help us. The badge is cursed.
fucking wasteman
Cock wombles.
Watford almost scored
one of those games huh
Reporting cycling gk for victory against us
We have so many players who lack a decent brain. And foster have himself wasted 5mins of play.
"Our rivals for 4th place are shitt,but we are even worse,damn !!!"
PR machine working overtime today
These players couldn't score a goal if their lives were depending  on it.
"take Fred off pleas, offers nothing in games like this"
Watching Bruno Fernandes is torture. Horrible Horrible footballer . Why is he shooting from there ?
Pogba has had no impact so far. Hope that changes
Just kill me.
Shaw has better technique than telles. But telles hustles more
HE DOESNT TOUCH THE BALL WHAT
"You guys were right. For a great shotstopper De Gea is, his distribution needs a lot of work"
Worst miss of the day
Ronaldo getting on my nerves today
Bruno so so poor today
Pogba trying hard to ruin the game. This trash is gone
Bruno not squaring it to Ronaldo earlier and selfishly taking the shot cost the game
[deleted]
Ronaldo is so unbelievably washed
Selfish Fernandez
Why pogba slows down the gamr so much that's his difference with bruno plays it one touch speeding up the game
Bruno needs to be dropped next match
We‚Äôd be easily in top-4 if we had at least PL level ST starting
"If we‚Äôd be able to convince Newcastle to give away Wood for Ronaldo, that‚Äôd be a steal for us"
Ronaldo will never be as good as Messi.
Ronaldo another signing Ole fucked us over with.
One of few decent crosses in AWB's career
If Cavani was on it would be 2-0
Even Roy Hogson is laughing at Ronaldo zzzz
"Our midfield can‚Äôt create shit. It doesn‚Äôt matter if we get Ronaldo or Cavani or their moms up front.

If you don‚Äôt get it by now, you should probably watch a different sport."
AWB is disappointing
Fuck this shit im done wid Bruno
That‚Äôs it I‚Äôm done
[deleted]
What's the point of Ronaldo spending all that time in the gym and having all those abs if he just flops over like a piece of wet cardboard when anybody comes near him?
Watford deserve the win - can‚Äôt complain if they snatch a winner with the amount of chances that were wasted
"Beginning to look like one of those games.

AWB sticks out like a sore thumb when we're dominating and on the front foot. Bruno and CR7 also having poor showing."
[deleted]
Waiting for the inevitable G/A so we can pretend Bruno has been good again
Why oh why is german accountant insisting on olaying sancho on the left side as he is clearly using left foot just for walking
"Glad to see that it is working, tactical masterclass"
[deleted]
Give it to Giggseh til the end of the season
Watching Ronaldo play like this makes me sad
We suck
THANK YOU RONALDO & RASHGOD!
Bruno can‚Äôt handle the captains armband
I would bring in Dalot
Bruno has been having a real stinker
"What a joke ü§£. At home, match almost over and still can't beat the hornets that sits 19 on the table ü§£

What a f\*cking joke this United team is! üòÇüò≠"
It's gonna be one of those days isn't it
WHAT THE HELL ARE OUR PORTUGUESE DOING :(
"None of Telles, fernandes, and cristiano can carry the ball effectively and they make up our entire left flank"
"Telles has a 3 second pass ticket, he can't dribble even when he has the opportunity to"
"The tempo is ok, we have to many players who want to play a Hollywood pass though for no reason , if its not that we're trying to make it as easy as possible for Ronaldo despite him being shit."
Finally coming to the sobering conclusion that we simply do not have a good team is very painful considering my hopes at the start of the season.
I'm genuinely worried about the xG after this one. It has bullshit draw written all over it
Fucking VAR has stolen this win from us
I can‚Äôt watch anymore. I‚Äôm out.
No movement FC
I think Matic should have Captain armband today.
Bruno needs to stay out of the box ffs
Of course Ref wouldn‚Äôt give us a pen
Absolutely abysmal
Ronaldo got that Emil Heskey form lately
rashford would do well in the League One
Bruno and Ronaldo have been awful today. Worst players on the pitch for us
Honestly we are cursed
Fuck the VAR ref
"May have missed it but, where‚Äôs mctominay?"
"On paper, this is the best United team"
Rashy would have shot it at the goal keeper from the left wing
Wonder how many offsides Ronalda has had this season? Feels like sooo many.
Bruno stop messing shit up
I'm tired Robbie
Bruno man... F
Boutta un-Viva Portugal üò†
Bruno is playing like absolute shit. How many chances does he need today?
Awb is so meh in attack
Goal could be the size of sun and we‚Äôd miss it by light years
This part of the season our attack has been shocking just pure shocking.
"Christ, our attack is crazy good today but we just can't kill it...    
Hopefully the first goal will start a huge score."
Going to be a Ronaldo wall hit
Why let ronnie take.
why does everyone act like Ronaldo takes every freekick?
That's a penalty
Fred‚Äôs been quite good today barring that shot from distance
Nil nil at halftime FC
Nill-nill... duh!
That's so poor Matic.
this game as a Rashford 91st minute winner written all over
Just tuned it.. what's the story so far?
Should be a pen
How cant we score omg
1 nil loss incoming
Not our day.
Fred????????
Fuck this shit.
Our left side is problematic both Telles and Shaw both not doing enough
Actually cursed.
How fucking easy does it need to be for these players? HOW FUCKING EASY DO YOU NEED IT TO JUST SCORE A FUCKING GOAL?!
"AWB with a great cross, if that was dalot it‚Äôll be a throw on on the other side"
Matic is tiring I don‚Äôt think we will win this
USELESS
Shaw and Rashford coming in.
Luke Shaw.... :O tell him to sit down
Why telles
Bruno has had a very poor half
"Happy to see Cleverly get clapped off, he won a lot here"
Drawchester incoming. ü•≤
That was terrible from Ronaldo. Wtf. Just pass or shoot or something. Legs given up week over week with no one to play in his position.
What good does a ball like that do Bruno?
"That's most likely top four gone, at least it'll hopefully lead to a large turnover of players in the summer, squad definitely needs freshening up"
"Honestly shocking that we don‚Äôt have a goal.  No solution in sight either.  Every week, same shit."
By this rate we would go to conference league next season
Bruno took the long shot.
Ffs
Useless pieces of shit
"Fuck off, paying 100$ a month for this shit. Im done"
"Here come the reddit posts about how we passed the eye test and all the Instagram stories about ""doing better"""
The team seems terrible mentally. They have been losing their minds after the first setback in the game for so long now. Not just conceding a goal but (individual players) even after getting dispossessed and missing a chance seems to knock them out of focus.
"I know it's been said before, but a pure DM changes us. Allows us to push up slightly higher, gives freedom to Pogs, Bruno, or hell even Fred."
oops
But they told me thats why ronalfo joined
For now
Make-up?
We buy Rice?
True but it needs to lead to a goal more often. He was brought for his finishing which he still has but not enough to warrant the whole team being built around him
Or out of bounds
"Yes, chase the ball! You‚Äôve just come on!"
No it wasn‚Äôt haha
"Matic, Varane and Ronaldo of 5 years ago with the rest of this current lineup would be incredible"
Especially after our other senior citizen is never available for a match day and the only other player who can play the position got shipped out to sevilla.
"Absolutely this.

But all the comments are Ronaldo are idiotic. We have a 1B+ squad. They should be fucking punching down even if Ronaldo has a bad game."
Rashford looks like he is retiring at the end of the season
"Matic is a better footballer than Rashford atm, he brings a lot more control to the play."
"It's all Rangnick knows how to do though when we need a goal, just throw on every forward and hope for the best"
"Yep agree, but Matic run out gas should bring Mata maybe? After Matic gone Pogba follow run out gas."
This is the real problem. We have never really replaced Lukaku. Rashford and martial are not strikers. Greenwood could have been. But a top team needs at least 3. Not two 35+ plus out of their prime ones.
Yeah. I've also noticed how better they are on the ball as well. They're more physically resilient too. The passes they're playing are more accurate and everything is more intense
Not different from the rest of the season.
"He was either seriously tired or showing the age in his legs today. Just couldn‚Äôt run, control/hold up the ball all game.

We need a striker investment before next season"
He's got a good leap on him as well!
McTominay isn't good enough and needs to go.
"As sad as it sounds, it‚Äôs true.

Relying on aging forwards like Ronaldo and Cavani was always a risky strategy. Shipping out Martial, Amad, James; Greenwood nuking his career; then add an out-of-form Rashford‚Ä¶we‚Äôre desperately short of forward options. Luckily Elanga and Sancho have managed to show up and offer attacking options recently, but we‚Äôre still lacking a clinical finisher up top."
Exactly that.
The usual against lesser teams.
Yes.  They‚Äôve offered nothing going forward.
Pretty much. Decent number of clear chances.
Pretty much. Don't know how we haven't scored
Been very wasteful but creating loads too and dominating possession
"Yeah mate, could‚Äôve had 2 goals at the very least"
"Pretty much. 

Playing well with a lot of very close chances and poor finishing."
Unfortunately one is always injured and one is a scumbag.
"I didn't watch this game, but seeing Rashford there, I can tell you straight up, we are better playing with just 10 men, than if he's even on the pitch."
"Our finishing has been bad, but at the same time our chances haven‚Äôt been super high quality aside from probably two we should have scored. Most of them come into the box from wide which are either difficult to get power behind when they are loose or difficult to get a clean strike on when they come quick."
"Nonsense, I do it in Fifa all the time"
Arsenal did exactly that
Last week Conte said that it was the best group he‚Äôd ever worked with so take what he says with a pinch of saltZ
He is also part of our offensive players and he also missed
Yet we still believe there is a service issue
Let‚Äôs also give some appreciation to Matic
"When he‚Äôs on form no doubt, he‚Äôs got this unique quality where the ball almost seems super glued to his feet and he‚Äôs got so much power when in possession and powering through opponents when it‚Äôs a 1v1 situation. 

Overall though, still not convinced, runs hot and cold, seemed quite pedestrian for two thirds of the game today. It‚Äôs almost like an on and off switch with him. Like I said though, immense when he‚Äôs up for it. 

Can‚Äôt speak for the entire fan base but I do get a sense of indifference on whether he stays or not, especially because of his antics."
He‚Äôs so good but absolutely no legs
"Yeah, he‚Äôs looked solid"
I feel he is a little better and comfortable going forward now too
right. I am surprised to see how strong he is on his left foot
"100%. It‚Äôs been a glaring weakness for quite some time.  I get we needed a rw, but being so paper thin in the middle for so long is criminal."
CDM was more important than RW. The most ironic part about it is that we signed sancho for RW but he has mainly played LW.
What about the front 4 not being able to score more than 1 goal a game?
Love this!
I think you know the answer to that...
"I agree, think Elanga has brought the best out of him too. Helps that Watford are shit"
We would have been challenging for top 2
What fans? We are stakeholders here.  üòÖ
Or Ronnie doesn't hit the post from the 6 yard box
"Every time I wide awake watching, this kind of match happen.

and when watching while feel sleepy, we play a good game.

and now here i am fuming"
We need to start a novena and pray to god we would play any decent.  Else it would be a horror month.
Do Utd fans have a hatred for arteta?
"Has generally not worked, fingers crossed!"
This is the way
"Creates space as it draws the players centrally creating an overload on the left, been our best and most creative pattern."
Make him fill the important role left behind by Van De Beek.
That's what a DM is supposed to do
I usually dread his name on the team sheet but his passing has been amazing today.
Makes a difference when it's a true DM
Carrick vibes
Yup. Though his rested performances always makes me sad that he doesn‚Äôt have the legs and we have none other like him.
he makes it look so easy
Yet Elanga missed the easiest chance out of everyone
"It‚Äôs kinda baffling. I am tempted to say it‚Äôs just fundamentally not working with Ronaldo up front, but he has his moments of decent link up play and some really good touches, is actually getting some top chances too, so it‚Äôs not even that. Just a baffling lack of finishing for players who should really be doing better."
Ole.
Probably need a sancho
"Other than the finishing, this is dominant."
Yeah he's coming into his own. Great to see
Let‚Äôs wait and see if Rashy makesit on that list üòÇ
He can‚Äôt let them in if they‚Äôre not on target
he can start by stop giving minutes to the useless players.
How is bruno to blame
I wonder if Haaland would ever consider moving here... He would've buried some of those chances for sure
Let's see if you still believe that after we go to the Council House next weekend.
Cristiano masterclass ?
I was thinking exactly this
Take Ronaldo off and put Sancho in. 4-3-3 with Bruno around the hole/striker. I think that would be awesome.
and a baller as well
He's only taken 5 FK attempts in the league this season... The shit he gets for attempting free kicks every now and then is getting annoying.
Yes the whips on them i
üò≠üò≠üò≠
Of course he wants to win.. That's expected.
Whole team is just shit. Idk why people don‚Äôt say that instead of scapegoating one guy every game. It‚Äôs not as simple as one guy sucks on this team
More like when you miss a pass by 1 point
"Bruno lost same goals even more but no one is saying ""bruno should be benched"""
"it's a solid observation the ball moves really quickly with him & Mctominay not in the lineup. Mctominay passes backwards, maguire can't decide who to pass to"
Add shaw.  Shaw holds on ridiculously long
It‚Äôs an addiction
"""We need to be better"""
Yeah about that he was scoring till ronaldo defended it for Watford
Watfords shit
"Yeah now if only we buy an actual DM in the summer, but I assume we won‚Äôt"
"Yeah this sub is so toxic, we re having such a good game..."
 But Bruno seriously needs to finish that lol
Feels like burnley game
"Maybe switching Dalot and AWB according to the opposition, but otherwise yes."
Lmao
Its just ronaldo and Bruno tbh. Ronaldo has been terrible and our second only striker is only allowing himself to play one game per month.
Great game from him so far that‚Äôs for sure!
Just hoping he doesn't pull a rashford later on and drop off..
his passing has been good to watch
"Rashford is well above is xG in the league this season, his finishing hasn‚Äôt been the problem. Just hope he keeps it simple, keeps the ball moving."
Night mate
"I think he kind of does have to.

None of the rest of them wanted the responsibility, always looking to give the ball to somebody else so that they wouldn't be the ones to make a mistake in possession

To quote Ole, ""Just fucking shoot"""
They happen way too often though.
Cavani is stealing a living at this point. He is the rotation striker but is never available
"This! Why Ragnick didn't see that!! Oh yeah, he is god! nobody bench god"
Any idiot can post on a forum. Just need to ignore them
The sub is 90% idiots who don't have a clue.
I've literally seen only one comment saying Fred has been bad. Everyone is saying Fred has played well
AWB did nothing. Fred was ok if unspectacular. You‚Äôre making it out like they‚Äôve been class
"No, no. Let's not. Burnley, Newcastle and Leeds to go down, please."
He‚Äôs always been tricky
One amazing save and everyone thinks it‚Äôs 2017 again
cunting the opposition is my new favorite phrase
Don‚Äôt Jinx it!
"Relax bro, we‚Äôre off to a great start. Usually we don‚Äôt even get chances until the 65th minute. This is a great start"
There really is only two scripts isn't there.
Considering Maguires form I don't think it's that difficult for any Prem defender tbh.
"Even Elanga now, and Elanga a few games ago is a big difference. He is much more involved in the buildup and initiates more."
Delete this
He has. His positioning still worries me.
Hopefully his legs hold up
It‚Äôs only 1.28
u only can choose one
">The goals will come

We said this watching the Middlesbrough match though."
A case of Carntbearseditus
Does it? We're absolute cowards.
"I think if the ball gets blocked by a player or hits the woodwork, it doesn‚Äôt count as a shot on target"
Shaw assist rashford goal confirmed
Have more faith In Ralf‚Äôs subs. He did well the last two games.
I think he was fatigued. I understand the sub.
He's old and this league is too much for him now
He's old
Can‚Äôt finish either
They are now mutton chops
2 shots on target? No backup striker? Out of form forwards. Bruno clueless in positioning.
Ronnie botching 50 chances
I can guarantee you the statistical models and data  will be a lot higher on that performance than the emotional fans...
Nah Glazer prefer fame so could sell shirts more
Focus on the game instead of shitting on a player who‚Äôs not even on the pitch. It‚Äôs getting annoying with all the hate towards Harry
Hire this guy as the next manager ‚òùÔ∏è
It was watford. we get excited easily
Of course it is and look at the thread.  Plenty of people talking shit about both of them
We don't talk about bruno
"A mixture of fatigue, confidence and team chemistry, I think"
He's been poor not unlucky.
Elanga is sick haha
I thought it was someone outside at first it was that loud üòÇ
Still remember that free kick against Juve a few years ago. Beautiful
So satisfying to watch
"I was just thinking that. When they come forward Im kinda like, ""whatever, come at us,"" whereas with Harry Im like ""oh fuck no, help."""
I know we have Ronaldo but let‚Äôs be honest he‚Äôs miles away from his form. If we have a proper striker we are banging 3 every game
"Agree, the football is getting better. Just player who can't finish with several open chances."
These games are begging for Cavani. Is he available?
">Wtf is Pogba waiting for????

He couldn't turn and there were no supporting players in the box. There weren't any players making runs he could find either."
"It must be, there is no other way with this countless clear chances"
Well we need a goal desperately and Fred is more defensive role today due to Pogba also playing.
Agreed. We need to see Juve Pogba who was averaging the highest amount of long shots in the world at one point.
Happy Cake Day!
"Fergie did all the time, never wanted to settle for a draw unless it was a knockout game or a 6 pointer for the title race. 

Solskjaer did it when desperate"
Who‚Äôd have thought it üòÇ
You mean the Europa Conference League right?
Our best player tonight with Matic
City would be a better choice for nearly anyone unless they ended up just warming their bench.
Because we need to win
"Yeah I mean it is beautiful but Arsenal‚Äôs one point behind us with two games in hand, and we have a tough fixture list coming up. This game is a must win."
The football is great but if you can't put in the net it doesn't really mean much.
"Yeah our movement so good today, i love watching it beside our final third."
We need 3 points and this is one of the worst teams in the league in terrible form
"He was mostly unlucky tbf, not defending a weak play from him but he gave everything"
We‚Äôre gonna get Poch and Kane this summer..
"This is why we need a DM, just having Matic already helps unlock Brazilian national team Fred."
Has been in most of Rangick's games
I feel like that every season lol
No we actually had massive problems at times scoring under ole- July 2020 I think was one such time
"Yup, playing ‚Äúwell‚Äù at home to relegation fodder is now acceptable. Especially when playing ‚Äúwell‚Äù means finishing like a league 1 side"
Maybe he‚Äôs declining? That‚Äôs an option too
He hasn‚Äôt been that sharp tbh.
A goal and 2 assists would be great
Chelsea at the 2nd last match when we pass them for 3rd place
Just need to keep this up for the whole 90.
That‚Äôs Telles mate
"Same. Looking quick, sharp and focused"
We somehow need to have samcho in this lineup aswell and then i think this will he our best 11
Rashy is that u?
again
Fuck all evidently
Stupid that he needs to go down to get the penalty
He‚Äôs been crazy today
"To be fair to him, Bruno was in a wonderful position"
United post Fergie
Losing leads too. Players are to blame
2 meters wide is not a good hit lol
1.28
"He also doesn't track back enough. Sometimes he gives it away, then throws his arms up in frustration, while the opposition fullback runs into the gap behind him, and proceeds to jog back while his own fullback is trying to deal with a 1v2"
Should be a penalty in every season.
Foster could jerk off during the match and still get a million views on youtube
Can't wait to post about how we deserved to win this after we draw 0 ‚Äî 0.
disrespectful to Bruce/Pallister
Happy Cake Day!
So they just need to change a manager every time they play away
I would take off Ron man
"Wouldn't be surprised, but makes more sense to take off pogba"
Virgin airline?
Fancy a piggy back?
"To be fair, Watford aren't exactly trying to be an attacking force"
He definitely pulled something
No we‚Äôll win the match and say Manchester is red while they win the league again.
"Thing is much of our play was good.  We pressed, we had the ball up our end, we created great chances, we failed to score."
I felt that
And Rashford should not start too
"bro just sell him, this is a huge club we cant let emotions overpower our piss poor condition. Get maguire and rashford out. No need for new contracts to Dalot he has been okaish but never near the level of ball we need. Mediocrity has become our new standard ffs"
"His finishing also hasn‚Äôt been bad. Hit the post, had a goal disallowed, and the chance where he rounded the keeper was always going to be tough for him to score from. He‚Äôs done well imo."
These people just want him to fail. He‚Äôs been good so far today. Unlucky.
"By far, he looks electric when he‚Äôs got the ball at his feet today!"
gonna cost a goal someday in a big match. he has a really bad habit of blindly shooting
To be fair constantly pissing away goal scoring chances is pretty fucking annoying
"The problem is the lack of finishing, we‚Äôve all seen this pattern before, with many of those matches where we ‚Äúdominated‚Äù and ‚Äúplayed well‚Äù ending 1-1 or 0-1. It‚Äôs not so much the playing but the lack of an end product from players that are supposed to be finishers."
"Two questions:

1. What is your definition of ‚Äúthe top‚Äù?
2. Over what time period to expect this transition back to ‚Äúthe top‚Äù to occur?

Actually, a third question:
3. On what grounds do we ‚Äúbelong‚Äù at this ‚Äútop‚Äù you speak of?"
It‚Äôs like the way to make this English club great again is to stop playing the English players.
We are also playing the team with the joint most losses in the league. Don't get too excited.
And not concede in the first 10 minutes of either half
We always start like this. And then half time arrives.
Same. I thought Elanga was.
Seems to be in a bit of a free role at the moment.
I think it's a 3 midfield. Pogba matic Fred. Pogba and Fred are switching sides.
Looks like the 4222 I think.
Looks like the generic running from PES
"Well when Bruno won‚Äôt pass to him when he is wide open, I‚Äôd be annoyed to"
üò≠
How does this show we need a DM? We‚Äôve been poor on finishing.
I think Elanga should get a go.
I'd watch that for sure
With Telles there? No way lol
Make them do the fusion dance to become Dioron Da-Lotssaka
"Declan Rice is the closest. Incredible positioning wise, also a great carrier. Slightly down on passing ability, but decent enough. Shame that he might be priced out though."
And yet 0-0.
"Agreed, we really need much of that team chemistry from playing well. The goal will come later."
Okay but they will though
We need to clone matic and have the second sub on for the first at 60 to get a full 90 out of him though
Our back on 1st half so compose and full of confidence.
He‚Äôs already pretty great today don‚Äôt have to wait for one day
Shame he only finishes half of the chances he should
If sancho is coming on how could it be a defensive sub? Ofc it‚Äôs an offensive one
we are trashing them... we just don't score
"Well positives are great but results are what matters in the end. That's why despite a shit performance against Atletico, the result was still good and nobody cares about the performance after the game ended."
Especially with Fred winning the ball high up the pitch for us today.
"Not before we end up blowing our wad on Declan Rice‚Ä¶always a season or two behind on what we need, and always overspending on a single player."
Vodoo shit
Never thought I would say this but we have Ronaldo up top unfortunately
The things Varandel√∂f lets you do!!
A dream of spring
"What Im hearing is, De Gea screamer?"
Butttt victor varane pairing way better
I think injuries have wrecked him. Seems to be reluctant to move himself about physically which suggests he doesn‚Äôt trust his body
We haven‚Äôt had ‚Äúgood‚Äù results either. We‚Äôve dropped points to about 6 teams we should be strolling past.
I feel like I see this comment every week
*UECL actually
Not if you miss the target every time
50:0.50
2+
"2,16 - 0,55"
2.16 to 0.58. We're basically a meme at this point.
shaw telles putting in horrendous crosses all game
I think we just need to score the hundreds of chances that we fucking burnt
"I think Kane would be an incredible signing. Obviously would prefer halaand because of his age, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs likely he comes to us. Kane is lethal in front of goal and we need that"
"Not even lava for us anymore, just downright not happening"
Haha.. oh god. Least we're better defensively now.
"Yes and no.

He still legally owns the team. But now the trustees are in charge.

It also can mean no more sugar daddy tho."
How's Arsenal squad mediocre? The only person I'd take from you lot is Pogba
"They may have average players, but those average players actually want to be on the pitch and are in their physical peak/are developing youngsters. That club is actually recovering from the banter era and will probably start title challenging in a few years time. Arsenal are going in the right direction, while we are still suffering from terrible board management."
With u 100% id rather not go to Europa league if we're not qualifying for champion's league. I would rather we focus on the domestic league and cups and take our time to build our squad and not exhaust them with Europa  league games mid week so that they would be fully rested for PL games.
McNeill call-up imminent.
Sorry but really terrible idea. You can't just throw a youth player into the starting 11 and expect them to score goals. Especially not in such a crucial time in the season. From now until May there won't be a game where there isn't huge pressure for us to win
Nah there's a group of people here that think we should be bringing back Ole lol
winning all if we are honest here
I‚Äôd rather watch us get smacked by better teams than what I‚Äôve seen today
Ronaldo helps a lot and then his teammates are either incredibly selfish or can‚Äôt pass to him to save their lives.
"He's clearly past it. His form in the last 40 seconds is all that you need to decide that. Because only the most recent thing he's done matters.

Sincerely,

Reactionaries everywhere."
Yes that why everyone is saying he's past it.
Bruno being a selfish moron isn't bad luck
Team definitely gels better without Rashford's poor form affecting the buildup. Hope he gets back to his old form. Having his deadly finishing back could be amazing
Against the most out of form team in the league
"facts! crying, sweating and shiting."
3 atleast
Not unlucky. Washed up
He‚Äôs average at best and he‚Äôs lazy off the ball plus egoistically steals the free kicks
awb matic quality too
Still better than Eibarman
"The usual. Unless we're not scoring every chance, it's an awful performance apparently."
What is this your first time here
Yeah looks like they type more and watch less
Well to be fair it's infuriating watching our forwards miss easy chance after easy chance.
"Ahh don‚Äôt shit on Ronaldo‚Ä¶shit on someone else instead!!

We could just not shit on anyone, they have all been good, unlucky to not have scored but it will come."
Exactly
Couldn‚Äôt agree more
">Cristiano Ronaldo Premier League 21/22:  
>  
>Appearances: 23  
>  
>Non-penalty XG: 11.8  
>  
>Non-penalty goals: 7  
>  
>That is... disgustingly bad finishing

Yup - see above - 7 non penalty goals from 11.8 non penalty XG"
Ronaldo played better under Ole
"He‚Äôs a liability that‚Äôs what i think of him and he won‚Äôt settle for anything less than starting games. He spent his best years at madrid and came back to us when he‚Äôs finished. We don‚Äôt owe him anything, its the reverse. He should move when this season is over. United needs to focus on winning things now and not nostalgia."
"Add in the Champions League games and he's doing better than his expected goals. 1-2 good games and his numbers will be normal for the league aswell.

His linkup play has been better recently too, Was heavily involved in two good chances today and in the goal against Athletico.

But you're right, we bought a 37 year old Ronaldo to improve our pressing game and surprisingly he's not doing well at it."
"And here we go again, with the Ronaldo-agenda. Someone get these journalists out of here"
If I had a dollar for every time this sub said pressing.
he isnt...
it was well wide lets not start circlejerking
"Good showings with no goals are worth as much as the hole in a beagle. 

What we're watching is a second season of the PL Series ""Manchester United: Serial Bottlers"". 

Best character this season is the newly introduced Anthony Elanga. The rest of the cast is making sure they are living up to the name of the show.

Stay tuned to the second half of today's episode, where the characters make a 180 and turn into different players. 









For the worse."
Lol
Can we not have such a defeatist attitude when we play our fucking rivals
Nothing beats a cold night in Almaty!
"I don't agree with a complete drop but I think he really needs to be load managed, he needs to come off. He provides almost nothing by the end, especially this week since we've had so many games."
"Elanga played worst ronaldo missed a couple of opportunities but so did bruno, bruno lost a goal 1 on 1 with the goalkeeper when ronaldo saved a ball inthink it was bruno who did a horrible headbutt"
"Can‚Äôt even win the small ones, what chance do they have to win the big ones? This team will get embarrassed by City again."
"Don't worry, the performances will soon go south too - you can count on this group of players for that"
"We're playing really good football in most of our games, it's just the lack of finishing thats absolute shit. If they players can keep their heads up the finishing will come eventually. Then everything will just start to click nicely"
"Looking at the kind of decisions City have been getting for the last few seasons, I am not."
And a second turnover there
"We‚Äôve been saying that since Ole, not sure they‚Äôll ever learn."
"Seem like so, and  Pogba is further up with less defensive duty."
Man apparently. That Cristiano build up was neat too. Bruno fucked up immensely.
"We went down to 10 men because Maguire decided he didn't want to play anymore.

Probably would have won otherwise."
I want to see cornrow Hannibal play in the midfield so badly
I like the look of Hannibal but I feel he needs to bulk up before he gets into PL matches.
And prime Mata
"Better passer and maybe a more powerful runner, Rashy was different gravy at dribbling and the initial burst of pace for a couple seasons."
Story of the season tbh
Goals will eventually come
No again pls
In before og
We're going to have 40 shots without scoring by full time
"Good, Telles and Matic and Elanga look lively, just our finishing has sucked."
"We're dominating, but unable to find the net."
"Good, just not putting the finishing touch."
"89th, to Bruno."
"Really? We've carved out plenty of easy chances against them, we're just shit at finishing"
You sure?
Agreed - he would tear up this Watford defense today
My suggestion was bionic legs but that‚Äôll do too
Only a semi cause he didnt bury it
That would've been some goal
Fotmob app
1.7 [Fotmob](https://imgur.com/a/KNpOpAr)
We've gone from winning games we shouldn't while creating nothing to creating endless chances but being unable to finish them. Insane
"Watford aren't pressing or in possession, Matic can handle this for 90. Especially when he's playing great."
cross and inshallah
We‚Äôre getting only one point from this game at the moment. Losing wouldn‚Äôt make things much worse
He can‚Äôt run anymore
He doesn‚Äôt but we need this win desperately
"Nemanja has been great, but it is a sound sub considering that his legs tend to go in the last 15-20 minutes of the matches he starts."
Need a lot more than that
Really just need the players to focus
Need Jesus
Seems like every other game is ‚Äúone of those games‚Äù. So frustrating
One is a Loser apparently üòÅ
Us the whole 90 mins:
No we are losing points to Watford AGAIN
Don't need top 4 when you win the champions league üí™
Aussie?
Brighton play far better football than us
"Just the Lindelof & Varane partnership, Elanga looked really bright, that was it really."
We created chance after chance after chance. It was one of our best performances this season apart from bloody missing them all!
"Plenty. Controlled the game, created loads of chances, very few sweaty situations defensively (I think Vic and Raph should be first choice pairing tbh). 

Finishing was a nightmare though. Those weren't half chances. They were full on ""how on earth did he miss that"" chances.."
Defence.
No
One game closer to the end of the season?
Yes but let's leave it at that
"Kept possession most of the game, pressed constantly. Made a lovely play with quick one touch passes but Elanga just couldnt finish it. Just couldnt hit the target. 21 attempts I think. Only 4 on target. Ronaldo hit the post 2 minutes in. Bruno missed twice from the 6 yard box."
What's maddening about it is we'll lose more money from not qualifying for CL than we would have spending on another striker or a CM.
this blind hatred is just funny at this point.
"Oh he would, but the end result would be so so."
Maguires also way too slow. Probably why Rangnick dropped him. He's only decent against crossing teams.
Maguire wouldn‚Äôt have had the pace to get back in time to even attempt a sliding tackle there.
"Brunos stats are decent this season but i think he could of done so much better, missed loads of sitters so far"
Also known as the ronaldo
One shot in the post and then he start sulking. Fucking tired of it. He needs to be benched.
"Love Ronny, but his body language is certainly starting to get annoying."
It was blocked by elanga‚Ä¶
I mean he was the best winger in the world before he moved to the middle
"Was never going to get the power on it either I don‚Äôt think, Foster was there. Looking good though a goal will come for him."
Now you got me trying to find it for the rest of the game ü§£
Its not a pen
"its watford

Pogba has been here for years upon years. He could put in and effort.

He allows his agent to talk shit all the time."
Darren tucking Bent
They have tough games In hand but I agree
Might want to take another one bro
Mental days exist? I have to be in work even if I‚Äôm literally dead.
Sancho - academy striker -- former academy right wing.
Not at all really. Lots of players out there I really like and want to do well. Which just makes it more frustrating
"Team feels dysfunctional at times and like we have no direction - like we‚Äôre stagnating.
Lots of boos in the stadium at full time - a lot of fans feel the same"
"The players under Moyes were still the ones who lifted the premier league the year before so had already justified themselves to a certain extent. 

As much as it is painful to realise, we aren't entitled to a winning team even if we should expect one considering the size and history of the club. When things don't meet our expectations on a consistent basis and provide the stability we are expecting, we tend to lose connection or feel a disjunction of sorts. I'm sure earlier this season when Varane was unveiled and the Return of Ronaldowalker that most of us felt a deep connection with the club again because it reminded us of more successful times."
"It‚Äôs because they by & large are a team of arrogant, unlikeable cunts, by far the worst group of characters to play for Utd in probably 30+ years"
Nah I feel more connected than I have for a while. I think we look like a decent team who create a lot of chances. Today we just need to be more clinical.  I feel like we‚Äôve improved a lot under Rangnick.
Helps playing a toothless watford
Shawberto Carlos who?
He's not been the same since that injury.
"Friend, he has been declining. The man is 37. We can't expect him to play like he is 27. The problem isn't that Ronaldo joined Man United. Just ask Juve fans. He has been on the decline as is natural for an athlete at his age."
It‚Äôs ridiculous. We‚Äôve been really good
"Not to forget he would have had a goal if it wasn't blocked by Ronaldo.. and people are saying he is having an off day, not sure what game they are watching.."
Incredible is a bit much to describe it he's had a good game. He'd be having an incredible game if he taken the missed chances
no backup striker hurts right now
Not like finishing was what he was brought in to do or anything
"Almost every ‚Äústar‚Äù player in this squad has a hero complex that leads them to making the wrong decision in vital moments‚Ä¶Bruno, Pogba, Ronaldo, Rashford."
"500,000 a week"
And who should start in his place?
poor finishing tho
"Cavani is much better than Ronaldo as this stage of their careers. He hurries defenders, moves around the box and is more sharper. Ronaldo just moans too much even when he is the one who is making all the mistakes, he is just too static up front."
Cavani has been worse then ronaldo when he has played. Last good performance was against tottenham.
or we are playing relegation level opponent lol
And then upload it to YouTube lol
r/angryupvote
At least no penalty shootouts!
Neves in
Rice in
Tbf he muffed the shot terribly
At least 3 in this game so far.
4 in a season
Why you gotta be like this?
"He's the highest paid player in the league, we can't have Ronaldo as a bench option. Even if he was happy to play it which seems unlikely."
This made no sense. The problem was Ronnie replacing other people doesn‚Äôt solve that.
"His Non-penalty XG is 10.

Edit - nvm, different sites have different numbers"
"I wondered too. Sure he did miss several crucial chance, but his key pass is decent enough"
"Yeah hes had a good game so far, dunno what game these people are watching"
"""if he doesn't score he's useless"""
">He scored 1 which was just off and hit one on the post from that angle.

So he failed to score twice?"
Maybe because cavani is always injured. Greenwood is in jail and rashford is in an even worse slump. Do you ever stop and look at the players we have that can play striker other than ronaldo? Dumb question
Cuz cavani is injured
"Well our other options are Martial who was loaned out, Cavani who turns up to less than a third of games and he who shall not be named. We've put ourselves in a shit position of relying on Ronaldo and now he isn't performing we have no Plan B."
He upended the dressing room first and now he provides 0 value to the team in goals or play.
"It was a shit shot into the ground going into 2 Watford players if it didn't hit Elanga. What the fuck are you smoking?

Literally never stepped foot on a pitch if you think that was a decent shot and had any chance of going in"
Nah but we actually think that his constant moaning and throwing hands in the air while doing literally nothing else on the field is getting too much an this point
"Doubt you‚Äôve ever touched a football. Do you aim right at the keeper/defender/your own player when you are trying to score? No, you shoot where there is space. The whole right side of the goal was free - furthermore it was a terrible shot with no power and wouldn‚Äôt have went in even if it didn‚Äôt get blocked by a Man Utd player"
He looks absolutely spent
Maybe find a better permanent replacement
"yeah would be smart if he's just a late subs, he will have energy and the thirsty of goal in limited time given"
Actions speak louder than words
Keep that same energy for Bruno who‚Äôs missed more chances today and had less key passes despite being a midfielder
Man is a slug
Not sure why you‚Äôre being downvoted for stating a fact
You can roll the ball to him to tap it into an empty net and he will miss it and kick the grass instead. Such is his form now.
If he works on his crossing and shooting he'd keep his place
What are the lottery numbers?
I would've been looking at 15 y/o South Americans on FM
Lol yeah
Just an excuse for people to throw some hate his way. There was legitimately nobody for him to offload the ball to lmao
[deleted]
"Lack of effort, hunger. He‚Äôs ‚Äúmade it.‚Äù In his mind"
He played horribly last match too
"We created pretty good chances today; so unless chemistry affects finishing, I'd find it hard to agree with you."
"Ron had plenty of chances, don't think not finishing them was due to tiredness"
The one behind him let water drip out too. So weird
The Elanga chant
"Elanga's song, I dunno the words though."
Rotation.
But I need Ronaldo to score today
You can score from the shoulder so yea it's off
3-0
It‚Äôs fucking great
Koi smjhao ise
famous last words
LCB
Still puzzles me how we lost to these chumps.
ill
"According to the subreddit's sidebar, he's ill."
Especially for these insane wages
Dm when you find it.
Tottenham curse
Normal match for him these days
GOAL ONLY
i‚Äôm disgusted.
"He's been slightly declining for the past few years but he really took a massive nosedive last and this year. His technical abilities are nowhere near as good as before, he is also slow and sluggish, weak in the duels nowadays. It's really sad to see but I guess it was bound to happen someday, he's 37 after all."
"Ronaldo has no service. The crosses he received against Madrid weren‚Äôt even close to him. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs not to blame, but look at the passes he‚Äôs receiving. It‚Äôs awful."
He had every right to shoot there.
Lindelof been solid as well.
prime ronaldo matic mata would've won CL and PL
Do you ever not cry? Your life must be miserable.
37 yo lol
"pogba spread some good pass, he has less option with lacks of targets in front of him.

I like ronaldo but god, bench him for a while. maybe he can catch a breath a little, he's 37 and play 3x90 in a week

Rashford, the least he should do is press."
"Think Pogba did the basics really well. Nothing too flashy, still played some nice passes. Solid 6-7/10 performance IMO."
"If you think Pogba had no impact, you might be in for a world of hurt when he leaves and isn't replaced adequately. His impact waned when Fred and Matic were taken off because he was asked to play a role really isn't suited for."
Rashford being the impact sub with the form he's in shows the state our attacking lineup is in
"Pogba 1st half passenger. 2nd half he was much better upfront, but after our subs he had to play as a 6 and it was back to being invisible, even looked tired at the end."
Playing in serie a makes him soft
"Its not his season. Mate the guy is old, vant play anymore"
"Bruno's been creating chance after chance, what a shit take."
Nvm lol
Been bad for quite a while now.
Just today? Been like that for months
Just today?
No it won't Relax lad
The difference is night and day!
"Seriously you guys are blaming him whatever he does today, come on‚Ä¶"
Oh shit he could have but then he would be no better then neymar or grealish
"11v9, please include CR7"
"you'll get downvoted for stating it, but we can improve on him massively"
"Well the thing is who else is gonna be our starting 9? Cavani is doing a Bailly, Martial is off in Spain, and Greenwood is dropping the soap besides Mendy"
"Yep I agree that most of the time we are fucked by the officials. They make one slight touch outside the box and we were given a free kick, but if it's inside the box god forbids them to give us a penalty"
Fred was right behind for an easy pass
We don't need to press that much. We've got the ball the vast majority of the time. Fred off means pogba falls back a little and allows Sancho to go forward. Much more attacking taking Fred off.
You not the only one
MOTM
Really good
Awesome
"Fantastic, but he shouldve scored 1-2 times"
Really good but should‚Äôve scored once or twice. Love his runs and his energy
"Been good. Nothing crazy though. Some really good runs, can see his potential"
"A bit quiet but when we have seen him on the ball he's been really good, should have scored after a great move."
"Telles is actually really good at free kicks. Now shaw, I'm not so sure about..."
Well they're no good in the box. And telles is very good with a dead ball
We‚Äôve been playing great for the whole game. Just not scoring sadly
"We‚Äôre Adele now, singing at strikers who can actually finish"
Who? We speak not of this name
Lmao
Relax dude really hasn't been that bad were creating the chances to be had at least.
Pogbas cross in early minutes is a locked in goal for Cavani or a striker with slightly better movement. Ronaldo didn't even move expecting cross towards him. üòû
"This is obviously just speculation on my part, but I think relying strictly on Rashford's pace at a huge point in his development instilled some really bad habits that are going to be hard to break. Hoping he can make it over that hurdle and start doing the little things right again because I love the guy and he still has the ability to be electric"
VAR didn‚Äôt give him the service today tbf
What service.
"Way too reactionary considering we have sacked a manager and are playing under an interim. Harry and Luke have been the two best players or our defensive unit for the past two seasons until this one, and both were great in the Euros."
Lol he's just always hurt. He's been hurt for years now..this shouldn't shock people. He's got a couple months and he's gone
Wants to do nothing only score. Hate his body language when he doesn't get his way.
"it doesnt look like, he HAS an attitude problem"
Just doesn't accept anything other than perfection so he'll be annoyed by the tiniest of things.
Only people that make these comments are the ones that didn't play competitive sports.
Because he‚Äôs an egotistical prick. Still love him but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs good enough anymore tbh
That‚Äôs by far the most frustrating thing about the sport. It was definitely a foul but he gets punished for not going down.
Always annoys me when people say footballers go down too easy. If they stay up they can be impeded illegally and get punished for their honesty. Surprised Ronaldo wasn't smart to it.
Lulling them into a false sense of security. He'll get an assist and a goal.
Lol
He‚Äôs 37 bro
He scored in the last game he came off the bench tbf
As if he literally didn't score a last minute winner for us recently you tosser
"Is shiting pronounced like verb form of ""shite"" or am I overthinking a typo?"
Amen.
"Throwing fits every other minute, standing around when the ball is in motion."
"Elanga played worst , bruno lost 2 goals 1 on 1 with the goalkeeper  but they are not to blame? Lmao"
Amen
That wasn't a sitter.
I fucking hate that this is true
His passing is surprisingly very good
What exactly has he done wrong? He‚Äôs been more involved than telles and defended well
The best fullback title changes hands every week it seems
"He had no options, nobody presenting a passing option"
Finally looking like his form of last season. He has been really timid since we started struggling for real under Ole this fall.
CLENCH
The foot and eyes are cursed
Matic is doing well.
Lol how is this game on the board?
Yeah it‚Äôs the boards fault our players can‚Äôt make an accurate 5 yard pass
Who else does he have on the bench to throw in?
"His responsibility to make sure we win it this year so that we can qualify for the next. 

Top 4 is gone for sure."
"Ronaldo's thirty seven we should have never been reliant on him to guarantee Champions League, many of our players should be in their primes but are playing like complete garbage."
Then sadly your going to have to stop watching the games
Not just today that‚Äôs the problem
He's clearly fucking knackered. He didn't just leave it for the sake of it
Why you can‚Äôt stand it?
Yup
Yes
But Bruno is playing well today?
Fredian slip.
"I think it's because there can be a bit of a frantic nature to his game. He never seems controlled in his movement, he can be a bit loose and rushing around. It's good when he brings energy and intensity that you need obviously but there's a happy medium he can just go past sometimes"
Because replacing AWB with Dalot would make to much sense :V
Black Magic aka age
"The one where he hit Elanga summed it up

Prime Ronaldo smashes that in"
Literally so sick of hearing this bullshit while ronaldo misses chance after chance
His finishing has been beyond shit this season
"No it wasn‚Äôt. If it was man city, they would‚Äôve squared that opportunity"
Just our first half xg was around 2 (Laurie Whitwell on twitter). He created chances. Lmao.
We don't have any other striker though
Agreed 100000%
Matic has been our best midfielder today
"Don't knock Subarus mate, great cars."
"Wearing new boots so probably something with them, will switch to the other ones for second half."
He‚Äôs been an absolute menace today. I wish he would‚Äôve gone down for a pen but he still gave Bruno a magnificent chance
Lol why was this downvoted?
Wat
How the fuck did the board sign him. Worst decision we could make
Chill the fuck out. Ronaldo is shit too
If he was onside maybe
"He is frustrated with himself , he needs a goal"
Lol what?
How many times is he gonna be fouled then?
"Rash as a forward, Lingard or mata could come on then push Bruno to the false 9"
Rashy
Be careful the stat men will be out to get you.
"AWB actually had a good game though? Gave Elanga support on the right, and covered really well. Not his fault our forwards were wasteful yet again."
This game had nothing to do with AWB or rashfords. AWB was fine and rashfords didn't even play. This is all up top buddy. Keep your biases checked at the door.
Lol
"With that comment, Ronaldo would skyrocket it to row z"
"member the game vs middlesborough? 

its a shittier version. we should be up 2-0 but instead we are tied."
Best we‚Äôve played this season with some shambolic finishing
"Like dating that really shy girl that keeps teasing you to fuck, but every time you get a chance something stupid happens that ruins it."
We're absolutely dominating but we just can't get the ball in the net.
"Missed our best performance in years. Absolute garbage finishing,  but we've created a lot of chances"
"Nostalgia mostly, anyone with half a brain can see he's finished"
Ronaldo is depressing this team
Ronaldo has been shite today lol
Ronaldo has a big part in why the team is struggling. He's lost possession of the ball so many times from attacking positions
I'm depressed seeing Ronaldo. He's a has been.
It was Bruno‚Äôs shot. 100%.
This is not Ronaldo FC
Yeah he‚Äôs a bit of a moaner
it was AWB
That was Awb
It was Wan-Bisakka.
It was Aaron‚Äôs cross
"It was just a really difficult position and angle to shoot, he kinda had to almost turn 180 to take a shot"
No it isn't
"pretty sure greenwood happened after Martial was sent out. It was a good move at the time, but it has unfortunately unfolded horribly"
"if he didn't start then who else on the bench? cavani injured, and G case exposed after martial loan move"
Shaw as well he is so lazy when it comes to offside traps
I never thought I'd have to tell CR7 to go down
Probably been practicing passing to Ronaldo too much to focus on shooting practice
"Why, he's been good"
AWB has been solid though.
Professional footballers at the age of 25+ should not be needing dedicated sessions on finishing.
I don't know a telles in swinger aimed at the far post. Either get a head to it or it could sneak in the far post
‚Äûu…ê…Ø p«ùqqo…π «ù û…ês dƒ±l‚Ñ≤‚Äû
more like 3 up
If you run a lot you'd feel the need to spit often
"If they‚Äôre anything like me, I don‚Äôt swallow while running and it eventually just builds up. Plus cold air makes the saliva thick and sticky, don‚Äôt really know how else to describe it, so just spit it out."
I don‚Äôt know. When I played football I never spat. I also did other sports and still never spat but I will admit I did snot shot once after seeing footballers do it so easily only when I did it I snotted all over my shirt and then hands by trying to rub it off lol. Never tried that again after that.
Probably a bit of mud/grass got in their mouth?
"Several studies have shown that¬†exercise increases the amount of protein secreted into the saliva, especially a kind of mucus called MUC5B. This mucus makes the saliva thicker, which makes it harder to swallow, so we spit it out.

^ From Google"
[deleted]
"Rashford to score a late winner actually. C'mon Marcus, form redemption starts today."
Don't worry he doesn't want you to defend either
Wanna come over after the game and play FIFA?
"Feed Ronaldo, he's acting like a  baby."
Sameish? Less chances but really should have scored at least once with Elanga.
We never created this many chances under LVG
Delusions of Grandeur
Nope. That‚Äôs not something he does.
"65% want him to stay next season remember, unbelievable"
"He is not scared to sub Ronaldo off, we just don‚Äôt have anyone to play in that central position"
i need context
"Apart from a few good games, ronaldo performances in the league have been abysmal 

Hes done well in UCL, that's it"
"Ronaldo's touch has become so sloppy and I don't know why people don't talk about it. He tries to step over like he could 15 years ago but just ends up losing the ball. A lot of times, inside the box!"
Fernandes could have squared it to him and we would have won btw. Fernandes also missed another sitter in the 1st half.
He had poor passes and a couple of missed oprotunities brunos lost 3 goals 1 on 1 with the goalkeeper and his crosses were shit
Not playing well? He set up bruno so much he keeps missing and keep doing link up play from midfield also get no service from our midfield. What the fuck do you want him to do? Ronaldo dribble past 4 player and score the goal himself? Unbelievable
I agree actually. The composure that Shaw makes him a constant threat.
No he is not. At least not currently
I disagree. Current form it's telles over Shaw.
Are you watching the game? It's literally his first mistake of the game.
That wasn‚Äôt Bruno wtf
Which season are you watching pal?
"Like the others, he was lively, but himself, Bruno and Elanga all missed big chances. More disappointing for Ronaldo I guess as finishing was all he could offer."
Who for exactly?
This is so sad to watch
Elanga blocked his shot
that was a perfect cross?
He found the man...
Literally just crossed it to Ronaldo who hit the post. You're a cretin
What did you mean by costing him a bdr and CL?
Shut up
Him playing 3 games in 7 days is ego?
Same way we paid that for Martial and Maguire
Also a rapist
Ronaldo fluffed his shot
We have had like 5 super clear cut chances. We just can't fucking score
"Ya, stack him. Put him on Pogba for starters."
More often than not he will get outpaced and lose the ball.
What
Martial was at our club just a few weeks ago
He has to make crosses!
I thought we lost to a championship side
Fu k you talking about
We mathematically can‚Äôt drop a spot in the table even with a loss. But if we don‚Äôt get 3 points before our next fixtures we could be truly fucked. Sometimes the gamble is necessary.
It was flicked by Pogba right before reaching Ronaldo. What‚Äôs he supposed to do?
Ronaldo has been involved in every chance United have created. Bruno has missed like 3 wide open chances. I don't see what Ronaldo is doing wrong.
" Lol imagine watching this game and coming up with such a shit take, no need for excuses when there's nothing wrong."
You can take those 4 points all the way to the Championship üëãüëã
go fuck yourself
At the end of the day you're still southern so
"We finished him. The man is a legend, and we gave him no service for the first 15 games. He single handedly kept us in the CL. 

Now the man is a shadow and cuts a forlorn figure. Imagine him in a City lineup and he would have been scoring for funsies and giving Salah a run for his money. 

Alas!!"
Are you just spewing random nonsense? Ronaldo didn‚Äôt even do anything wrong in the play .
"didn't see the attack that just happened huh, keep the ronaldo slander plastic nonce"
"He has 9 goals and 6 assists in the prem this season, and 7 assists in the champions League. It's not as good as last season of course but still great numbers."
"Perfect game for him. With all this possession, he doesn't have to run at all."
Was it not a bit further out?
Spurs had just lost to burnley 1-0 they needed to make a statement after that
They did everything to miss in that game. Guy had a goal without a keeper in it and didn‚Äôt even get his shot off.
We absolutely need 3 points. Watford have hardly looked threatening‚Ä¶
His legs tend to go towards of the matches he starts.
"But our midfield is playing well? They're not the problem, it's the forward line converting chances."
[deleted]
Awful opinion
"I agree sancho on, but pogba should stay on. Id take of fernandes as he has been very wasteful today"
If we hadn't let him go he would come on today and proceed to stand around and do fuck all..
Looolll the number of downvotes any comment criticising Ronaldo gets when it‚Äôs 100% true.
I like him better at Man U then man city.
An assist would also be a stat doofus
Fuck off this sub you twat
Yeah imo no one should waste their time convincing you.
Shit take
Why pass to Ronaldo when he misses 9/10 chances. Bruno (our best player btw) might as well try it himself.
think before you type bro what üíÄüíÄüíÄnonsensical shit
We played well. Just the finishing is off for some reason.
Offside
Rotation and illness
Sancho could be rested for Mancity match
ill
Fred's been pretty good actually. üëç
Ralf is a good manager
BeIN Sports 1
100%
I think Bruno is on the left and Pogba down the middle
"Arsenal fan here. Watching this because I put a bet on Ronaldo goal. Wanted to say that Varane has never hit me as a world class CB. This was my opinion since his Real Madrid days. He has some good qualities, but lacks in others."
promising. were attacking but still struggling with the finish
Everything but the goal. Could easily be 2 or 3 nil. Need to score though
missing some big chances but hey at least we're creating them
"We have varane and lindelof, not Maguire"
This is ending 1-0 either 90+4' Cristiano or Cleverly
"
Playing ok so far"
Because he‚Äôs a better player
Only reason we're not winning is because we can't finish. It should he 3-0 at least by now defense has nothing to do with it.
Brilliant. Creating tonnes of chances but a little wasteful in front of goal. The goal will come if they keep playing like this
Or not
Looks like a 4222 with Ronaldo and Bruno as strikers actually. Very fluid though.
Playing really well but missing so many chances
"Playing really well, could've been 4-0 up easily. Just can't finish"
"good, elanga is class"
"Playing well, failing to convert any opportunities."
"Creating loads, missing loads. Have all the possession in the world but nothing to show for it"
We should be at least 2-0 up but we can‚Äôt finish
playing well but not scoring :/
"50 minutes in, I hope not"
Yeah Watford gonna get a cheeky goal aren't they?
Fred is doing really well with his pressing and there is also Rapha in cover. Going quite well so far. Sarr hasn‚Äôt been much of a threat.
"Elanga should stay on, Ronaldo probably off given his play today"
First one was marginal. Second was clear as day. Otherwise agreed.
No one apparently
"""Do you wanna see my pog collection?"""
4-0-6
No hes just too lazy
Haven‚Äôt had chemistry for 8 years now.
We watching the same match?
"Not watchin', are ya?"
">Horrible Horrible footballer

Get a grip"
"The absolute state of this comment, wtf"
Quit watching than because he‚Äôs here for a long time.
Yes he does.
are you kidding?
They've both missed sitters I don't think you can put blame on bruno
Rangnicks Man United can‚Äôt be bothered to beat Watford.
oles united lost to watford
Offside
Difference is Bruno missed two wide open goals
Why and for who?
Factos
"Yeah, how has Messi done this season? What a joke of a comment."
You mean Messi will never be as good as Ronaldo‚Ä¶. When Messi comes and plays in the Premier league then he will get my respect.
"Ole failed at a lot of things, but that was not an Ole signing"
That literally was not his signing.
Can‚Äôt compliment a player without sticking the knife in can you?
"Mate, our forwards have had the chances to make it 3 or 4 nil. This is entirely on Ronaldo and Bruno."
"You must be watching a completely different game, man. In case you're confused, another chance was just created by a midfielder in which Pogba flubbed."
Apart from all the missed chances we should've put away?
He's been one of our best players today...
Did you start watching in the last 3-4 minutes or so?
Lacking creativity? We‚Äôve had like 4 clear cut chances
"> Lacking creativity

we wasted something like 5-6 clear chances this game This time our creativity is absolutely not our problem"
Are we watching the same game? We have missed like 6 goals
"We're playing good man , creating chances as well. Smh"
"This ain‚Äôt it, chief."
So he can get a pen or a foul duh.
They deserve it much less than us. Just because we fuck up doesn't mean the opponent have been any good.
"he's playing pretty well bruh, others are wasting chances too..."
He looks exhausted xD empty tanks
Stop talking
Because they cut inside rather than the out and our winger.
Wingers on switched foots is a thing. So they cut inside
What has been wrong with the tactics? We've utterly dominated the game.
"It never dropped to him. There was no chance of him ""finishing"". Smh"
Really?
Can't really complain about the refereeing after missing so much. They'd probably miss the pens too lol
Well no one else is making those runs lol
Probably not when the defender wins the ball
He's out with illness. Should be back next week.
Injured
I would argue Sancho is on better form rn
Sancho is absolutely a part of the best United lineup
It really really isn't
He‚Äôs been making up for Rashford being out of the lineup.
"Same story new day, lots of chances, no finishing."
"We should be up 3 or 4, but our finishing is abysmal"
We cant finish and ronaldo is offside all the time
I think they both do their job well just both get exposed on the inside way too much
???????????????? Telles has played well
Lol the deadwood are staying
Our team in a nutshell huh
"Confirmed, eating rice makes you de-age."
"Yeah, don't know what's up man.. Bruno also missed so many chances. 

\> but not enough to warrant the whole team being built around him

Totally, he is here for like a season or so, I hope we have a more humbler/younger squad next season."
Everytime martial was called upon this season he did a great job. He's already been involved in 3 goals for Seville. We are desperately short of strikers. We really could have done with him today. I don't know how much money we've saved sending him on loan. When we did it i said it could end up being the difference between champions league and not and people laughed
"This isn't the odd bad game for Ronaldo 

He has been poor for a while now."
"He‚Äôs been like that all season. He can‚Äôt dribble past anyone anymore and is the slowest forward we have. His one quality is that he is a lethal finisher, but that‚Äôs just not working right now either."
"That scumbag would have been world class, I was really excited to see him play with Ronaldo. He would have improved soo much"
"Frantically clicking through the ""welcome to the club"" emails at the beginning of the save so I can put 15 players on the transfer list"
They both did but both offered a shit ton
Only Ronaldites peddle the service line - it‚Äôs their way of rationalising his decline
Agreed - him and Fred doing all his defensive work releases him and Fernandes to create
yeah the level of frustration I was starting to feel when he got the ball hasn't been there today
What is the answer!?
"League is gone I think but it is something that will still keep fans with a little joy inside if we somehow steal our way into the next round of the CL.

Knockout football always has you dreaming whereas the slog in the league to need consistency has already depressed us all.

In other words, it's a hate watch to watch us in the league right now, but I'll always keep believing miracles can happen in the CL. You're not out till you're out, whereas in the league we've already lost but need to keep playing each week."
"I actually quite like arteta 

But a lot of fans here are upset because he has proven to be a better coach than ole but also proven to be a good coach overall

Arsenal play good football. Have a lot of young players and don't really even have a world class player but they look like a good side"
"I think many of them hate the praise Arteta received while Ole was still in charge and hate him for winning the FA Cup. In their minds they believed Ole was a better manager who wasn't getting the credit he deserved and many still delude themselves that Ole was better than he was hence the revisionism. 
I can guarantee this is the reason."
"The amount of times this kid scored for us or looked good, I think you can give him some slack mate. Bruno got another 1v1 in front of the goalkeeper and missed an easy goal."
Idk people on here have been telling me we are worse now than under Ole üôÑ
:'(
Man I'm trying not to cry here
"He missed like 3 easy chances. No one else missed as many, don't know why Ronaldo is being targeted the most."
Not a chance in hell he's moving to Utd to play Thursday nights
"Forget Haaland, no chance he comes. Plus IMO Raiola baggage not even worth it. Depends obviously on the manager but I think someone like haller if Ten Haag comes and someone like Darwin N√∫√±ez if poch comes"
"Don't get me wrong, I definitely don't want to bash CR7, but this season, his free kicks were very poor.    
And it actually was like that during his last Juve season as well :("
weve had managers before in the last few years who wouldnt do this
"yeah because bruno created most of the chances, did you even watch the game?"
"I'm sure he's more tired of saying it than you are of reading it.

He's been one of the few players consistently at a good level this year."
"Shocking really, our usual first half performance is almost enough for me to turn the game off. No forward progress, nothing but back passes. I‚Äôm almost on the edge of my seat watching this game"
Lol In no way does this look like the burnley game
"Yeah I‚Äôm not singing high praises for McFred of matic in the midfield, but him abandoning the system has severe negative consequences, whether that‚Äôs turning the ball over, taking absurd shots, or blasting low crosses in when the time could be taken to get a better opportunity."
He has benched him when cavani was there. We don't have a replacement and we're running him to the ground.
Probably because they‚Äôre getting downvoted to oblivion and self-deleted after a minute or two
Found another one ^^^
Yeah this say more about Maguire than about Viktor
"They won‚Äôt, unfortunately"
Yep it‚Äôs frustrating but what can you do.
You're wrong. stat models will include the conversion rate. The conversion rate in this match: 0.
Fair enough mate. You‚Äôre right we need to support everyone on the team.
Harry wasn‚Äôt worth the money.  ‚ÄúLindel≈ìuf‚Äù all the way!
Lol I know it's a fairly controversial approach but I've found that you often have to score to win the game
Elanga get the umbrella!
no no no
Yeah but you‚Äôll get downvoted for speaking facts
Those microphones are amazing lol.
"Oh yeah me too, was a thing of beauty!"
Exactly. Harry needs to gain his confidence back.
"Posting this after we drew to Watford. Controlled the game (Man Utd (2.53) 0-0 (0.51) Watford) but our strikers are horrible, they should hang their boots of shame"
I meant in the post Fergie era. It's been rare
Great. 28/29 year old is what we need.
I don‚Äôt think you guys understand how much Kane would improve us lol. He‚Äôs unbelievably good. Would work with us amazingly. Obviously age is an issue but a solid 4-5 years maybe more isn‚Äôt bad at all.
what do you expect from 36 years old player
I'm aware Sancho isn't on the pitch
Yes X
Incoming SIUUUUUU come on lets go
It had the shape and looked better than 90% of our FK this season.
"Bro! So I think it was against Brighton I may be wrong. But Rashford got dispossessed on the edge of our area, the opposition player managed to get up, maintain his balance and get his shot off. Which must have taken 5 seconds (a long time in football). Rashford still wasn't on 2 feet, he just couldn't be assed to get up. Then he just stood there with his arms out. I hope I'm wrong but I don't see him coming back from this 18 month performance slump."
Ooh didn't even realise! Much obliged
"Aye. And with Maguire's boulder-like maneuvering, Dennis would have me concerned either way."
Sounds like typical United hahah
"at least we are trying, compared to before."
Huh this team smacked us 4-1in the reverse fixture and all of those started that game.
I'm trying to not ask for too much man
If we play like this continuously we will score ;)
lmao
"To be fair Varane and Lindelof have been great together lol. But yeah, no scapegoating today."
"Yeah I'd agree this is the most likely case. If that's true, can we really justify his place in the team? He's a hinderance to every single phase of play he's involved in, we're essentially giving the ball to the opposition by passing to him at the moment"
Agreed. This was an excellent opportunity to gain some points and get momentum going into tough fixtures. I hope I am wrong.
"Underperforming United is on the same level as the overperforming Arsenal team, I think that proves the Arsenal squad is mediocre. 

Bruno, Ronaldo, Sancho, Pogba and Varane walk into the Arsenal team if you don't consider the recent form. Any sane Arsenal fan would agree. 

Bruno walks into every PL team even right now.

Besides, I'm appreciating Arsenal here and you find your way into a United thread to prove some dumb point? No wonder you get bantered at every chance."
"> Sorry but really terrible idea. You can't just throw a youth player into the starting 11 and expect them to score goals

Ronaldo is providing nothing on the pitch right now he cant even score goals so you absolutely can throw in youngster and maybe he will score something its litteraly imposible to be worse then ronaldo is right now"
"Not even form, he just needs to keep it simple and pass more vs trying to beat 6 people in one go IMO. For now, I am happy that Elanga can start and Rashy can come late no to build his form. Would be so nice to see Sancho, Rashy, Elanga all in form at once."
"Still yields 3 points if you win, and we can only perform well against the team we are playing against ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø"
"Not the same as 5 years ago, but he‚Äôs doing all the right things."
agreed I think most players played well just super unlucky
At least we're creating them dude and they aren't half chances like usual. It's enjoyable actually watching us link up play the goals will come.
The amount of finger pointing and absolute tantrums he has is ridiculous and frankly embarrassing
">His linkup play has been better recently too, Was heavily involved in two good chances today and in the goal against Athletico.

Yep, his link-up play has been better the last few games.  Overall this season it hasn't been great, but I will definitely give you that it has improved recently.

> But you're right, we bought a 37 year old Ronaldo to improve our pressing game and surprisingly he's not doing well at it.

The bottom fell out I'd say."
"It‚Äôs a football sub, should we not talk about pressing?"
He was when I commented
Thats why i said least shitty
"Yep, try paying attention."
They‚Äôre no more our ‚Äúrival‚Äù than a fly rivals a lion‚Ä¶
We tend to pull rabbits out if a hat in those games in the past especially when it seems we have jack shit chance. Still 11 games left.
To be fair Spurs does beat the shit out of City and lost to Burnley
If we compare this performance to that 0-0 at Palace near enough a year ago..world of difference.
"Oh yeah, lets turn into arsenal supporters now‚Ä¶"
The struggle is indeed real.
What position does he usually play on?
"It works out for some without bulking up, David Silva from City days comes to mind."
I agree! We would have been much higher in the table if not for this
Guess that's about on par
Not really
"oh i would have arrived, if he had buried it"
"Definitely, great one touch play."
"In fact get Muhammad, Buddha, Yahweh all of the lads"
"So, in other words, no."
yea yea blah blah. I still support him and hope we keep him and put some actual talent around him.
Calling my boss as we speak
"Nah, not really tbh haha Just pulled the ""family emergency"" card today. Hadn't taken a day off in awhile and figured why not today lol"
Danny Welback
We've played worse opposition and performed worse this season so I'll take whatever positives are on offer
He was brought in to play football and he has done that well today
"just  use trashford, at least we have more bigger chance when ronaldo subs in with his thirsty than when he is starting."
That will come :) the fact we are getting all these chances is very encouraging
"That wasn‚Äôt just a comment on the opening ten minutes, but overall all season. And we have been quite shit against terrible teams all season"
"For one season to have him rested and fit for the big League and CL games it would be better than this.

He would still be starting 25+ games across all comps and likely be far more effective no?

Other option is letting both him and Cavani go in the summer which seems unlikely."
The problem  is we should have subbed ronnie and kept that midfield. Even adding bruno infront at this point and getting sancho on for ronnie would have been more balanced. We would have won this game coz their fullbacks were poor
In the match thread right at the end of the half. Ive seen comments asking ronaldo to be subbed. Lol. Who for? My nan's cat?
"I get that we don't have a lot of options, but surely at this point his presence is more detrimental than not. I'd rather see a united with a front 3 of Sancho, Elanga and Bruno with Pogba behind them and a McSauce or Fred/Matic pivot."
"I‚Äôve been telling my friends this for weeks and everyone thinks I am insane. But what do I know, can‚Äôt question the goat"
Pretty clear you‚Äôve never even kicked a ball
"The dude has literally had great link up play with pogba, elanga, etc all day, are you blind or just intentionally making shit up lol 

He is moaning because he will be wide open for a goal but instead Bruno shoots it into the keeper or someone passes backwards or ignores a run, etc. I‚Äôd be frustrated to. Who wouldn‚Äôt be"
It‚Äôs clear you‚Äôve never kicked a ball. Thanks for the reply.
"Definitely a must in the summer. At this point, we might as well go with a false 9 (take your pick). Shocking that a club our size has this issue at this point in the season."
Well bruno is at least giving us something every matchday while Ronaldo is useless bar Brighton game
I‚Äôm not just talking about that attempt. He‚Äôs been missing sooo many chances the last two months. He‚Äôs so far away from what he used to be
Aye that makes sense!
"ah ok, fair"
Don‚Äôt you dare put that evil on me Ricky Bobby
Ole tax
"While you're right to an extent, he had chances today that were good enough. He didn't convert them"
He had a couple of Grade A chances today and bottled them.
"Ronaldo is underperforming his xG by like +4, he is definitely the problem, those 4 goals could have been anywhere from 3-12 points if he had scored the chances.

Edit: He is now underperforming his xG by +4.32 after todays match: https://understat.com/team/Manchester_United/2021"
"Why do you say this when it is so blatantly not true? 

He is massively, MASSIVELY underperforming his xG, he is finishing (7 goals from play in 23 league appearances)  waaaay below the level of service he gets (11.8 non-penalty XG)"
did you watch today? he was failing to score time and time again Its time to face reality he is past it.
"Meh if there's a better, safer option you should always take it"
Agreed
You enjoy how this squad plays? You must not be a United fan
"Pogba held onto the ball for too long multiple times today, jogged in the middle of park, almost gave away a goal at the end. It was Matic who was spraying passes."
So 6 years later we still don't know the best position for Pogba.
Pogba was atrocious
"I agree with you, if i state that he has disappointing throughout the season, some will come and mention we are in CL because of him only it seems, im tired of hearing that, so i filtered out this post."
You sure? Definitely fucking seems that way.
"""rElAx""

Shut your mouth"
"CR7 at least runs. 

so its more a 11v9.5"
"Bruno false 9? 

Give Rashford a look there? I don't know"
Yup we‚Äôve been hella unlucky and our finishing has been ass
[deleted]
 ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
"All of our chances came through good dribbling by Elanga, idk what game you watched. I'm not blaming the game solely on Ronaldo, but he's *Ronaldo* and *Ronaldo* is playing like hot shit."
True. I have this feeling every time he plays though. And i definitely don‚Äôt with any of the other 3 guys.
Was talking about ronaldo haha
"Just don‚Äôt play him, rewarding terrible performances"
True!
Just sick of the song at this point tbh haha. Minority opinion by the looks of it!!
Have you seen the shit he missed
"Definitely mate. Wouldn‚Äôt be Fred without all of the attributed madness though, do think he‚Äôs been performing much better as of late."
AWB has had a good game tbh
"Don't blame age in this one, he was playing well during the start of the season. I don't think age was a factor for him when he missed all those chances."
"Well he missed chances as well, and there was a clear chance for him to pass to ronaldo for an easy tap in."
Get one from academy at least he will be working hard
I love this attention to detail
Ppl don't understand football....
"He‚Äôs right. Been a bit unlucky on the finishing, but his build up play has been fantastic"
ford
Can you not comprehend English?
Do you think he‚Äôs united standard?
Sometimes I wonder if people just roll into these threads to drop comments they've seen getting upvoted the past few weeks. Calling out AWB after this game is a wild take
Rashford didn‚Äôt play?
And he is the one missing all the chanches. I knew when I posted that comment that I was going to get tons of downvotes but who cares. This sub is full of teenage fangirls who started watching football 3..4 years ago and can't take any criticism for their idiol.
That‚Äôs the problem. We are over using this striker more than he was in the last 6 years.
For Dalot's attacking intent
Flip sake robbed man
"Ah yes, the classic snot shot. Always a crowd pleaser"
This is our best game of the season. Baby steps.
But the crosses were equally woeful
He said he‚Äôs stepping down from his Chelsea ownership but he isn‚Äôt selling the club
Exactly shaw's vision and creativity and runs is something else and he is more solid defensively
Don't know what game you are watching but Bruno put a shit cross after Shaw
The one where 7 is being useless shit again.
"I would actually put jadon sancho in and move bruno to that position. Get the ball flowing faster and have more chance creation opportunities  from the middle. 

Sancho left, elanga right.. bruno central"
yup he wants to play and is throwing tantrums when he is not played
Horrendous business.
True but I mean City level chances. Even Leeds today had a big chance that we have never had this season.
Oh i see..you‚Äôre not watching the games. We‚Äôll he‚Äôs been shite for the past few months
If thats the attituelde that the club takes its a ridiculous  one. I want to win this game and with no midfielder  we aint winning. Fucking sissoko falls down and gets up and still gets the fucking  ball.. why? Coz we have no midfield
"He‚Äôs forgotten where the goal is 

How many chances has he wasted???"
"Haha just as I sent it, that happened. Fair play"
We started with a 4-2-3-1. The 2 is Fred and Matic. What game are you watching?
"its actually because of martial statement, hes a lazy trash"
No
"Ronaldo is our top scorer btw and the top scorer of all time, pretty sure he can score that"
"He's an atrocious player mate, no idea how people who actually watch him play think he's good."
At this point playing well is useless if we can‚Äôt beat the bottom pit teams.
Was Ronaldo offside or was Bruno so the whole thing is irrelevant
the AM match that's two weeks away?
"Who do you want to be subbed off? Ronaldo or Bruno since they couldn‚Äôt score chances? 

Don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm downvoted. I‚Äôm just saying normally we won‚Äôt sub off Bruno nor Ronaldo."
Based on what? Just curious.
If we keep creating chances we'll score. There was nothing wrong with Ronnie hitting the post or Bruno's flick of Pogba's great cross other than a bit of luck really. Teams don't survive onslaughts over long periods. This has threatened to be one at times but they've been able to get out every now and again
He has been quite good this match
"yes, need a more attack minded player on, no need for him in game we dominate possession like this."
"I grew up watching prime Fabregas , Mata Ozil and so many others Bruno in comparison is a awful footballer"
I grew up watching proper play makers
I'm talking about build-up play not finishing ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Maybe he‚Äôs watching a replay of the away game?
Lol. Just got on the game. My bad
Thank you.
Yes i forgot about him dont no why
"Well, he went before the Greenwood news hit. Obviously we would still rather have him here than not"
"Cry more all you want. He plays in front of McFred with a shit midfield overall. He has been scoring all along but suddenly stopped this year while still scoring for his country.

There are idiots in this sub watching a game expecting Ronaldo to finish every time who have not seen football over the years or other teams play for that matter."
He hasn‚Äôt adapted his game to his age. He‚Äôs still trying those runs and coming deep to get the ball. He just need to be a fix in the box now. He‚Äôd make a great super sub but he‚Äôd never tolerate that.
"That‚Äôs unfair. With the exception of Ronaldo, he‚Äôs shiiite"
"That this team is worse than Juve's? Come on, man"
"That‚Äôs understandable, thanks for the insight.

>Arsenal play good football. Have a lot of young players and don't really even have a world class player but they look like a good side

Glad to hear that. There‚Äôs holes in the team that still need fixing but we‚Äôll see what happens.

Honestly this method of ours (of investing in youth) doesn‚Äôt guarantee success at all, even in the long term. But I think Man Utd would be wise to do it as well- I see a lot of your fans complaining that the players have massive egos and are arrogant, and as an afc fan I can relate to that all too well over the years. Young players, or at least most of em, tend not to have those traits and you can mould them into the type of player you want them to be."
Thanks for the insight
"Don‚Äôt worry the Dennis 93 min winner is coming. Counter attack from a Ronaldo mistake, left side of the pen box, beats DDG near post"
"Just need younger legs up top honestly. For as much as I love Ronaldo, he's basically useless if he's not clinical. Just not enough legs in him to provide a well rounded game. :( People comparing him to Cavani need to see the reality, there's a reason why Edi is always injured..."
"In the way we are missing our chances, it does. Let‚Äôs hope Watford doesn‚Äôt figure their shit out at half time"
"Well just think of that lost shot in the 92nd minute. We had the ball for a full minute on the edge of the box and nobody tried to take it on, nobody tried to make an angle for a shot or made a decent run. 

Pogba gave it to Rashford who gave it back to him, then to Shaw who puts in a cross that Ronaldo didn't even jump for, eventually the ball gets shuffled across to Bruno who at least tried it. If we take more shots through a crowded box instead of shuffling we at least run the chance of getting a deflected goal or rebound or similar. 

We were never going to score the way we were playing"
Rightfully downvoted. Prats. I'm not Fred's biggest fan but he's been brilliant
Lmao
If you think modern statistical analysis is rating players' finishing off summat as simplistic as conversion rate over a sample size as tiny as 90 minutes you have a lot to learn about football analytics. The underlying numbers pretty clearly point to the idea that quality chance creation is the best predictor of results
We‚Äôd pay 100m and get two years out of him before his ankles starts giving out completely.
"Playing a bag of salt & vinegar crisps would improve this team, it‚Äôs not saying much"
"37. And maybe not to start every single game, be the most paid in the team, and cry whenever he gets dropped? That‚Äôs what I expect"
I‚Äôve already gone siiiuuuu twice so far üò≠
Idk about compared to before it‚Äôs been quite prevalent under Ralf that we play well but shit ourselves up front
Yeah so I don‚Äôt understand why *this* shows we need a DM
"Who said Arsenal are overperforming? This season we haven't won any cup mate lol. We had one of the worst starts to a season and we're seating two point behind you with 3 in hand, what does that say about United? Why would Sancho walk in to our team? Because of what he did in the farmers league? ESR and Martinelli vs Sancho? I wouldn't take Ronaldo too seeing as you lot also don't want him. 

Lastly how are you appreciating Arsenal by calling us mediocre?"
"While you‚Äôre right to an extent about Ronaldo, there‚Äôs a better chance of his form improving and him starting to score again, than there is of an 18 year old with no senior football experience being able to lead our line."
Wtf?
Standing perpetually offside isn't the right thing
poor finishing
You say that but we got kicked out of the FA Cup against a Championship side because our forwards simply couldn't score the chances that were available to them.
Sure bud. We talk when the whole team is pressing.
 Christ the state of you
"CM/CAM but they‚Äôve also experimented a bit with him in a deeper role and out on the wings. He‚Äôs pretty quick on the ball and has decent passing. I think if you had to classify him it would be under playmaker. But personally I think if they bulk him up just a touch, so he doesn‚Äôt lose his speed and is better at shrugging off tackles, he could fit the bill as a ball carrier/playmaker.

Edit: I also say cornrow Hannibal because his hair was typically this amazing flowing mane of hair and he switched it to cornrows somewhat recently it seems haha - which reminded me of Carmelo Anthony being ‚Äúhoodie‚Äù melo"
Very true actually.
Ok ‚Äúy‚Äôall‚Äù
Agreed
Yep me too but it seems like Rangnick is afraid of dropping Ronaldo
"He can be a goat and not perform at the same time, the question is about coming up with performances. Rooney was falling at United but he put value in other ways. Messi ain't scoring much right now either. 

The generation is shifting, Ronaldo wants to hold himself to standards as well, he won't be here if we don't make 4th, but this is as much on him as it might be on anyone else in the team. 

It felt like when the season start we had to change our game to suit him and our season got messed for it, and now that we play a system that isn't meant to suit one player or another, his performances have tanked."
Then how the fuck is he top scorer if he had only one good game
Watford defended very deep the whole match. Holding onto the ball was a necessity at times IMO. He created some chances and passed well. Matic did what he always does and makes us cry out for a DM every match.
"We actually do, alongside two midfielders - a CDM like Matic and a B2B like Herrera or Fred."
Fuck off
We're 25 minutes into the game and you're bitching like it's over
"Yes, he's been missing chances, but his on-field play has been great today."
ye but dalot is still upgrade offensively compared to him while shaw for telles is not changing much
Okay choose to be a twat. Pogba has played well and opened space.
What even is united standard these days
Totally separate discussion; I think he's good enough to be part of the squad. World class RBs aren't widely available to just be bought.
"He's not united standard with his strange playstyle, palace was a good level for him. Regardless, he's been picking up form over these past few games."
Lots of dumbasses on Reddit who don't even bother reading that they're replying to honestly. Cesspool.
You just don't want to put the blame on daddy Ronaldo that's it.
"Yeah.. and he played in PL that's very physical demanding.

should we tried our luck with our academy players now?"
‚Äûu…ê…Ø p«ùqqo…π «ù û…ês dƒ±l‚Ñ≤‚Äû
True.... unless it was Borthwick Jackson whipping them in lmao. That was literally the only thing that kid could do
Shit sorry I thought you said Bruno took that free kick
Didn't see him throwing any tantrums when he was dropped and cavani started. But sure.
Huh? You want to win but going all out attack to win against a team who is playing for a draw is bad? To each their own I guess
What‚Äôs bout everybody else?? You‚Äôre just commenting hate when it has nothing to do with the current play in the game. Bruno missed a chance and an open pass to Ronaldo with an open net. Elanga missed a chance.
"Come on man i get he's not playing perfect but he's just been unlucky lately, bruno misses an open chance aswell, let's just support instead of being negative"
Bruno has scored the same amount of goals as him in the EPL. And it's not like Ronaldo's the same goal scorer he was 10 years ago.
Ronaldo was.
Oh sorry i mean Mancity my bad.
Ronaldo. I think Bruno could do better at the 9 at the moment
You have to be trolling. I don't have time for this
Well it would appear teams do survive onslaught over long periods if no one can finish...
"He‚Äôs been ok, just don‚Äôt want to set the bar after 50 minutes"
"Go outdoors, take a walk, relax and come to the realisation you know nothing of football."
"Lmao, you are the one crying trying desperately to defend his poor performances

Hes missed numerous sitters and missed some again today and has been missing chances for a while now

No one said he has to finish every chance but he is missing too many while his overall game has declined drastically. 

Hes been poor. 

Banging in goals for his country, his goals for Portugal, he only scored against Ireland and Luxemburg in qualifying lol

It's not ronaldos fault, we have issues everywhere but he has been bad for a while now"
"Are you supporting United or Ronaldo, lmao. I bet you were a Juventus fan not long ago."
tbf he has adapted his game to his age...the problem is he's 37.
No it‚Äôs not
"Honestly our fans complaining about egos etc just use the roy Keane method of analysis

It's all about passion and trying but in reality, we aren't very good and oles lack of coaching had a massive part to play 

A lot of our fans delude themselves that we did well last year when in truth, we were average. The league apart from city was a shambles 

Lampard, Arteta, ole debate was quite popular here and arteta comfortably beat them both

Showed a lot to get rid of aubameyang and push through the kids. Fair play to you guys"
Sounds like one of those FM matches I hate
"Ok in that sense I can see it. Hopefully we can put a few in, in the second half!"
"I see what you mean and agree we need players to take risks in the final third, but I also think as a player you need to know the situation. At the end there, you‚Äôre hoping you can squeeze it through a tight window or get a very favorable deflection, if neither happen you‚Äôre either going to get hammered on the counter attack or you‚Äôve just wasted the last chance of the game because of the time wasting the other team will perform. 

To be fair to the players and ultimately the coaches, it‚Äôs almost impossible to create a successful strategy against a team that parks the bus like that. You crowd the 18 yard box with 9 defenders, a goalie, and 5-6 attacking players and you need some serious luck to end up with a good chance or clear shot on target."
"Yes, business is all about conversion. This is the final output. If you don't think like that, then you should go to analytics course. There is no point to hire a bunch of analytics to tell you it's great build up but no conversion. And it shows in lots of matches, not just today"
He has a good injury record.
"we dont have any other striker. cavani always injured, martial loan out, greenword fckout.. we stuck with him for the moment"
Fred‚Äôs able to flourish
"> While you‚Äôre right to an extent about Ronaldo, there‚Äôs a better chance of his form improving and him starting to score again

he is garbage for something like 2-3 months and its past seasons he wasnt setting the world on fire (scoring in serie a is not something impresive look at lukaku). I would rather gamble on one of our kids to randomly performing good then hoping that 37yo ronaldo will find his form"
he is not though
Ok we're not even 30 minutes in I guess the games lost then yeah?
"Every other player in the frontline is getting through twice as many per game, it‚Äôs normal that it comes up in conversation."
My example could have been Januzaj but he didn't perform we as long/consistently as Silva did.
"This!!! I think after that tantrum he threw a few weeks ago, Ragnick has clearly been a bit more cautious about pissing Ronaldo off, or making him the center of the story."
[deleted]
"AWB  was good in offence today, and he made some important slide tackles."
"Sub par and mid table evidently. 

That‚Äôs why everyone is just happy with certain players just jogging about."
"I agree. I think Dalot has a slightly higher ceiling of potential and links up better going forward, personally."
"Couldn‚Äôt give a shit about Ronaldo. He doesn‚Äôt suit our play, obviously. We sold shirts and saved him from city. Job done. It didn‚Äôt work. Move on in summer. 

All of you cock suckers living on Rashfords dick downvoting anything bad said about him are just as bad as the Ronaldo fan boys."
I would say even playing Lingard top in games like today and using Ronaldo for more high profile games would be better.
No worries :) We have been absolute shambles
"Its not about going all out attack. Its about control. We win when we control the mid. Thats where the battle is won. What we just did will result in at best a draw. Coz if i was hodgson, tell the players to keep the ball in mid. Pogba is lazy and bruno cant keep his position"
Ronaldo is the reason we still have something to play for this season.
Not long-term. Obviously we had chances to win today but these are shite. Our counterpressing can improve massively still and if it does we'll put teams away regularly
No of course not. But potential
Goals and assists cant fool me .
Which sitter did he miss today or in the last 3 games?
Been a United fan since Rooney joined so since you were born honey.
If we don‚Äôt score soon I might have to intervene
Me being frustrated with a clear pattern I've been seeing of our forwards missing sitters is me saying the game's lost?
Every other player in the Frontline isn't 37 and isn't playing every single game either. Apart from Bruno who does more running than a coordinated press anyways.
This ain't your inbox keep bitching tho
again potential upgrade from awb to dalot is there while changing telles gives us absolutely nothing
We‚Äôve controlled the match the entire time even after subs. If we couldn‚Äôt score with 6 attackers we weren‚Äôt going to with 3. But you going with the pOgbA lAzY talking point tells me all I need to know
"If Ronaldo wasn't playing, someone else would be playing in his position instead. It's not like those 9 goals would magically disappear, and that we'd been playing with 10 men the entire season. Any striker could net 9 goals in 27 games. In fact, Bruno has scored as many without even playing as a striker OR taking our penalties.

Ronaldo isn't having a great season, and it's fine to admit that. It doesn't lessen anything he's done before or how amazing his career has been."
Fool is a very good word to describe you
"He hit the post from 6 yards out lol

And then he hit a sweaty straight into Elanga

Bruno should have also scored"
"Lmao, think it‚Äôs time make a change"
"Dalot is good offensively but AWB made some important defensive contributions this game, not sure if Dalot would have made those."
Dude am not going to get on this with you. This is a game we could have won by subbing ronnie. You believe what you want
Ronaldo has carried us in meaningful games. Meanwhile bruno puts in a 2/10 most games and then statpads an assist or goal which then papers over the cracks. His lack of silverware in his career is evidence of this.
Grow up.
"Look he had a bad game today zero doubts.

I just don‚Äôt think we should expect much if he is going to start every game as a 37yo.

Second, our squad should be dumping on Watford 24x7 vs what was today. If today was a Ronaldo or a Bruno problem, I would be happy because it‚Äôs fixable maybe not in the short term. But we have deeper issues where a majority of the squad plays like shit."
That wasn‚Äôt a sitter. Just because he is 6 yards out doesn‚Äôt mean shit.
"And there we go, unfortunately"
"Lol I didn‚Äôt initially say a damn thing about Ronaldo. In fact I agree with you on that point. But Pogba was not lazy today and even after subbing Fred and Matic off nothing changed in terms of control, in fact we gained possession in the second half. Everything came down to absolutely terrible finishing, even after adding attackers. 
If you don‚Äôt want to discuss it then just stop replying and believe what you want."
"I agree 

But in the long term we can't be relying on him either  because we don't have the team to build around him and he can't play as a lone 9 and prefers a strike partner 

He is still a good player but its a bad match. 

We need to replace various players and need a right winger after all these yearsb"
"Yes it was, the defender was on floor and it was from around the middle"
"Ronaldo has scored 7 goals from play, in 23 league appearances this season, from 11.8 non-penalty XG - that is sewer tier finishing, utter shit"
"Yeah, that is deeply, deeply disappointing. It seems we can never put a full 90 mins together. It‚Äôs always only 45. Pogba doesn‚Äôt seem to be fit for 90 right now"
Dude chill off
"Ofcourse Ronaldo should have never been our go to striker. Guy is 37yo much past his peak. There are better strikers in every league. He should be used in specific games where he has advantages.

For Bruno, it‚Äôs not the age but the burn out.

We need a full rebuild with a manager who knows the game inside out and doesn‚Äôt over use the shit out of players. Even Ronaldo didn‚Äôt play every game under Sir Alex. Same with Rooney or Scholes or Ferdinand or Vidic. We are abusing these players at this point and not much is to be expected tbh."
"What? Can‚Äôt discuss tactics without being agreed with? Again, if you don‚Äôt want to discuss a topic, just leave it alone."
Lol i cant discuss tactics with you coz all you do is downvote and offer a point to make yourself be right. I have no reason to discuss tactics with you.
"I‚Äôm not sure how you‚Äôve missed this growing up but discussions of any sort usually involve giving reasons why you think your point is correct. I haven‚Äôt downvoted anything, but all my comments in this thread are at zero too. You‚Äôve offered nothing to support your view but getting butthurt about someone disagreeing with you and saying ‚Äúgo away.‚Äù It‚Äôs a match thread for *discussing the match*, don‚Äôt be surprised when people respond lmao"
Lol ok
